“Detox” is a loaded word. It conjures up a medley of diets, from juice fasts to apple cider vinegar cleanses, all in the pursuit of a flat tummy and clear skin. While these might be effective in the short-term, they’re not necessarily sustainable in the long run. And here’s the secret they’re not telling you: your body naturally detoxes, your lymphatic, digestive, and cardiovascular systems working together to flush out toxins and keep your body glowing from the inside out.
 
Instead of forcing a detox on your body, give it a boost by adding nutritious options to your daily routine. Eliminate anything white, processed, and stuffed with sugar and opt for foods high in protein, fibre, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory compounds. Here are five of our go-to recommendations for incorporating into your everyday diet to help you look as good as you feel.

### Warm Lemon Water
It may sound simple, but Ayurveda and Victoria’s Secret models all agree there’s no better way to start the morning. Drunk before breakfast, it helps stimulate the gastrointestinal tract and remove toxins. Hydrating your body and getting a dose of Vitamin A and C so early in the day also wards off dehydration and the risk of adrenal fatigue, rousing both your brain and your body before you’ve even checked your emails.

### Probiotics
Probiotics help your body properly break down foods so you can more efficiently absorb ingredients while populating your gut with friendly, healthy bacteria. Expect better digestion, a flatter stomach, and overall better health as your body makes the most of the nutrients you’re giving it. You can take them as a supplement or find them naturally in plain yogurt and fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, kombucha, and kefir.

### Leafy Greens
Your mum wasn’t lying when she said you should eat your greens. Leafy vegetables are loaded with chlorophyll, which helps the body process environmental toxins, while phytochemicals promote blood flow to the liver and kidneys. If kale’s not down your alley, cruciferous veggies like broccoli and cauliflower are also nutritional powerhouses.

### Turmeric
Ah, turmeric. We can’t boast about you enough. Curcumin, the golden root’s main compound, helps detox the liver and clear it of metabolic wastes, in turn detoxing the blood and reducing inflammation. Not to mention the host of other health benefits, from treating arthritis, slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, preventing metastases that form in certain types of cancer, and aiding in weight loss. Sprinkle powdered turmeric in soups or salads, or make a latte using ginger, black pepper, cinnamon, and coconut milk.

### Apple Cider Vinegar
By now, you’ve probably heard someone rave about ACV or have a coworker who swears by her morning ACV shot. Drinking vinegar might not sound appealing, but liver detoxification, weight management, and body alkalization should. Maintaining a healthy alkaline pH level can boost mood and energy levels throughout the day, as well as keeping your body better protected against infection. When buying ACV, look for a raw, unfiltered, and organic option with the mother still inside. Don’t worry: you’ll get used to the taste. Dare we say you may even start to like it?
