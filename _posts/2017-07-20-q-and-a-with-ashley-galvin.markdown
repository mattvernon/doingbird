Seven years ago, [Ashley Galvin](https://ashleygalvinyoga.com) wasn’t anywhere close to doing savasana, let alone handstands. That was, until the then 25-year-old attended her first yoga class: immediately, she knew she had found something special and the rest, as they say, is history. Ashley has been teaching for the past five years, developing a strong personal and social media following for her flexibility, strength, and belief in living with an open heart.

We chatted with Ashley about the importance of awareness, her favourite snacks for when she’s on-the-go, and the secrets of self-love.

**What makes yoga so important?**
Yoga teaches us self-awareness. I believe this is the most important of all. Through self-awareness we treat ourselves better in the way we eat, the way we move, our internal dialog and how we treat those around us.

**How has it changed your life?**
I am healthier, happier, stronger, kinder, more in tune with my body . I am blessed to have made it my career so that hopefully I can bring others to the practice.

**What is the connection between a healthy body and mind?**
It’s all about awareness. There is no separation between mind and body. So often when we act out of selfishness or desire without putting thought into our actions, we start to tune out the messages our body sends us. Yoga helps us to slow down and come back to that natural awareness, helping us to listen to our bodies and the signs they give us.

**Between a healthy body and happiness? **
A healthy body includes a healthy mind and a healthy outlook on life. Happiness is a choice and an outlook. There is always something to be grateful for. 

**Tell me more about your food philosophy.**
When I first began my practice, I decided to take around 2 years and try every different "diet.” I wanted to experience first hand how my body felt when I ate certain foods and eliminated certain foods verse eating what I was told was healthy for me. What I discovered was, we all need something different. What makes me feel my best might not work for you, and vice versa. 

**Best healthy nutrition tip while on the go? **
Keep healthy snacks in your bag at all times so you are not tempted when hunger strikes. Bananas, nuts, protein bars all travel pretty well. Find what works for you and plan ahead. 

**Favourite yoga pose, and why?**
I am always drawn to handstands. I learn the most about my body while practicing handstands. I gauge my strength and flexibility level and most of all they require such concentration. You don't have time for your mind to wander.

**How do you keep yourself motivated? **
By keeping it fresh. Whether that is taking a new class at a studio I have never been to or finding a new teacher. Even trying a different style of yoga. You don't have to replace your favorites, just mix it up a bit. 

**Anything else you'd like to add?** 
The most important step in whole body wellness is self-love and self-acceptance. Our bodies change from day to day. Our balance shifts, our focus shifts, weight, strength, flexibility shifts. Be grateful for your body wherever it is today.
