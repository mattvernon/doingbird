Whether you’re looking to lose weight, clear up your skin, or just live a healthier life, we all know there’s no better way to accomplish that then by diet. After all, your wellbeing is 80% governed by what you eat, so a clean, plant-based diet, like our Soulara meals offer, is essential for looking good and feeling even better. But what about that other 20%? Show your body some love beyond just making sure you eat your greens (hint: it involves less exercise.) 

**1. Bottoms up:** We know, we know: this technically falls under diet, but it’s so important, we had to make sure we mentioned it: stay hydrated. We’re made up over 60% water, meaning water is critical for optimising your physical and mental health. It will boost your mood and energy levels, help regulate weight, and lead to better asleep, among a laundry list of other benefits. Aim for 1 to 1.5 liters of water, adjusting for your weight and activity levels.  If you want to amp up your water game, consider adding fresh fruit to your normal H20, or squeezing the juice of half a lemon into a cup of hot water. Coconut water is a tasty option, and be sure to limit coffee and alcohol, which will dehydrate you. 

**2. Don’t be tied to the gym**: There’s a big difference between being a gym rat and being healthy. While regular exercise is important, respect your body and recognise that it needs rest, too. For one, if your body is telling you it needs to sleep or have a day away from spinning, it probably knows what’s best so you can return to your workout game that much stronger next time. Your body also needs time to recover, crucial for developing muscles and improving endurance

**3. Leave stress at the door:** Sometimes, it can feel that if you aren’t stressed, you’re doing something wrong. We’re here to tell you the only thing that’s wrong is letting stress rule your life. Yeah, some of it is unavoidable, but don’t let yourself get anxious over the little things. A lot of things are out of our control and there are endless ways to worry about how might have dealt with a situation: why not focus on all that you’ve accomplished and your future goals? Stress also happens to be one of the biggest factors behind inflammation and chronic disease, but is luckily a problem you can directly solve. 

**4. Break bad:** No, we don’t mean binge watch Breaking Bad (although if that’s what you need, we say go ahead!). Being healthy doesn’t mean depriving yourself — after all, if you constantly feel like a diet’s prohibiting you from enjoying what you want most, you’re not likely to stick on it for long. Instead, follow the 80/20 rule and eat clean 80% of the time, allowing yourself your favourite indulgence. Like a couple glasses of wine with friends? Have a sweet tooth? Taking care of your health should make you feel happy, not stressed (we’re not fans of stress).
