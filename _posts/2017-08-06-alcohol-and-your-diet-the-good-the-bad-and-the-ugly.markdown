We get it — we love a glass of white wine at the end of a long week as much as the next person. But what about the impact on our body? Alcohol’s impact on wellness goals is constantly debated, and we’re here to go through the good, the bad, and the ugly.

* The good: It can be beneficial for your health. Some studies tie it to a healthier heart and longevity 
* The bad: It’s not great for your health. For all the studies that discuss the benefits, there are just that many that attribute alcohol consumption to a variety of cancers, a serious toll on your organs, and a negative impact on your brain
* The good: It can be a great way to unwind and bond with friends
* The bad: It can be addictive, and going out every weekend can get expensive and we’re not fans of the toll stress — financial, health, and otherwise — can take on your body

The consensus: Like with most things, alcohol should be enjoyed in moderation, but you don’t have to cut it out entirely. If you’re going to drink, make sure you take the necessary steps to keep your body clean, hydrated, and feeling alert the morning after.

* Choose the healthiest option: Go with the lesser of two evils and opt for a dry red wine or clear liquor. A great cocktail option is vodka with water and a splash of grapefruit or lemon juice. Try to avoid overly sweet options. Beer won’t do you any favours, and craft cocktails might have hidden sugars.
* Keep hydrated: You’ve heard this advice before, and we’re here to tell you again. Alcohol is extremely dehydrating, impacting our electrolyte levels. That means we’ll feel lethargic and moody, and your skin will dry out. To counter this, match every drink with a glass of water. Coconut water is high in potassium, and can be great mixed with vodka or as a supplement when you get home.
* Don’t forget to eat: Just make sure it’s the right type of food. Protein is a good option as it slows the rate of alcohol absorption. Think organic nuts, beans, or quinoa, or our Moroccan chickpea and couscous tajine. 
* B positive: Drinking depletes minerals from the body, especially B vitamins. Taking a B supplement before and after drinking can help revive your body. 
* Show your liver some love: Alcohol is metabolized primarily in your liver, broken down by enzymes into substances that can be toxic when they build up. Help your liver out with milk thistle or dandelion root tea.
