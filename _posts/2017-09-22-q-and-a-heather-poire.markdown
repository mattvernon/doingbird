Nearly a decade ago, Heather Poire was diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease. Now, the woman behind [Sunday Morning Banana Pancakes](http://sundaymorningbananapancakes.yummly.com) credits a plant-based diet with turning her health around. Her popular, inspirational blog has been used to document her love of food and the power of plant-based foods, along with some drool-worthy recipes. We chatted with Heather about her story, who she’d most love to cook a vegan feast for, and all the benefits of a plant-based lifestyle. 

**Tell us a bit more about your health journey. You were diagnosed with Crohns.**
 
In 2008 I became very ill — Doctors were not 100% certain what was wrong. I was given several different medications, which I reluctantly took, but I wasn't getting any better. After six months of "trying to figure it out,” the doctors had diagnosed me with Crohns. All of a sudden, my world came crashing down and with it came a chronic illness with no foreseeable cure and an endless list of medications. I thought to myself — this can't be right- there has to be something more, a better way to beat this thing. 

**What was your healing process like? **
 
I stopped my medication and began researching more holistic means of treatment - herbal supplements and probiotics. Honestly, I think I tried to convince myself I was getting better, the reality of the situation was I was a lot sicker than I wanted to believe. I headed down to Boston to meet with a new team of specialists — for the first time I really felt as if I was being heard. It was determined that I did have upper Crohns, which only 3% of people with Crohns are diagnosed with. Dr. Makrauer placed me on predinsone and 6MP which I stayed on for 1 1/2 years, finally I began to feel my true self again. 

**How did adopting a plant-based diet impact your health?**
My stomach was no longer angry and I felt like I had my life back. 
September of 2010 I became vegan. My health improved 10 fold, I went off of all my medications. For the most part, I have been in remission. I truly believe I have my plant-based way of life to thank. 
 
**How has your diet impacted your mental and emotional health?**
Every day I feel good about what I am putting in my body and that what I choose to eat doesn’t take a life or cause suffering.

**Any advice for someone recently diagnosed with a chronic illness?** 
Never give up and there is always hope. Be an advocate for yourself –speak up or find someone different who will hear you.
  
**What one person would you like to cook dinner for, and what would you serve?**
Woody Harrelson- a massive vegan feast!
  
**Secret to keeping a positive attitude?**
It takes so much more effort to be angry and negative. You have the power to choose each and every day to be happy or not.
 
**What's your current favourite recipe on your blog?**
[Avocado Black Bean Salad!](http://sundaymorningbananapancakes.yummly.com/2017/07/avocado-black-bean-salad-white-corn.html) 
 
**In your opinion, what are the other benefits of a plant-based diet?**
You are treading more lightly on the Earth, [have] glowing skin and know that your plate is full of love at each and every meal is something pretty special.
