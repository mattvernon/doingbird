Blurb: We shot in Adrienne’s house in Sheepshead Bay which is very close to Brighton
  Beach. It is nearly at the end of the train line in Brooklyn and a predominately
  Russian community. The black and white portrait hanging on the wall in the photos
  is her mum, age 11. Adrienne’s mum passed away when she was AGE – she is wearing
  her mum’s cowboy hat in one of the photos. Jake and Johnny have been best friends
  for seven years. Oh, and Danie is in love with Johnny and Johnny is in love with
  Danie. Sheepshead Bay, March 2018.
