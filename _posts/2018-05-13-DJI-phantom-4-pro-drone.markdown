Credits Text: "Beware, this drone can see you! And quite clearly, at that. Capture
  clear, crisp shots from the sky. Watch it hover and whir â€“ and be sure it is watching
  you back. This particular model also comes with the revolutionary and unsettling
  Gesture Mode, allowing you to signal it through body movement alone. \n\n**[DJI](https://www.harveynorman.com.au/dji-phantom-4-pro-drone.html)**[
