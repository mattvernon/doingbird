I like to dance, but I don’t get out much
So tonight is really special
I’m having a good time
Oh when the music’s pumping and you can’t talk Feel my low pressure

Another thing,
Sometimes it’s hard being a girl dancing by yourself Cos people think its an opening,
You know, to meet you
And they think you’re trying to incite a conversation And that the dancing is only a preliminary
Not the actual reason that you’re there.
But for me it’s not like that

And sometimes you have to Feel my low pressure

I walked in and I felt good
I wanted to hear my favourite DJ

I’m having a good time Feel my low pressure
