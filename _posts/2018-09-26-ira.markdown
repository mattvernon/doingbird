"My parents had a Zenit and I picked up the camera because it was the only thing at the house because I am from a rather poor background and it was the only hobby I could push myself towards."

"For me photography is about conversation and connecting with a person."

"I think over time you have to accept there are ups and downs and sometimes you are producing so much work and then next month, next two months, you don’t see anything."

"I found myself in Los Angeles because here you can be taking pictures year round. The light is soft and there is so much outdoors.. it’s not a struggle to find where to shoot, whereas in New York you hit a wall at some point.. “Am I going on another rooftop? Am I going on the street?" And again to I have the same background of Brooklyn or Midtown or whatever buildings."
