'My name is Yulia and I'm from Smolensk town, Russia. I always loved wandering around flea markets in Japan when traveling and I discovered that they sold a lot of vintage kimonos. I fell in love with how beautiful they all were and with so much history (some over 100 years old). They are mostly hand painted and made from silk. So I started collecting them.

I then decided to start an account on Instagram to try and sell them to overseas. **[LOVEFORKIMONO](https://www.instagram.com/loveforkimono/)** became popular between friends and their friends and soon enough my collection started to fly to all over the world. I've had designers buy from me for fabric inspirations. I have sold over 300 kimono since I started a year ago.'
