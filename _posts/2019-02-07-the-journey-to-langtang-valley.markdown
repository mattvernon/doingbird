March 2018, I started the journey to Langtang valley, 3514m from sea level, northwest of Nepal. A 4day walk from a town called Syabrubesi based at the foot of the mountain.

Famous for its tracking routes, this place has attracted mountaineers from all over the world to catch a glimpse of one of the most beautiful valleys in the world.
