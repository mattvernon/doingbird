Australian fiction is having a moment right now. Markus Zusak, Jane Harper, Matthew Reilly and Liane Moriarty are just some of the authors leading the way in a resurgence that’s seeing Aussie novels charting in countries all over the globe in the last couple of years. In other words, fiction Down Under is heating up as much as the dry, arid land in which the stories are often set.

When you look a little further than the authors already lining the bestseller aisles, there are many budding authors waiting eagerly in the sidelines to pounce. Waiting for their time to shine in Australia’s reformed literary glow. Sydney-based Chris Gill is one of these up-and-comers, whose new coming-of-age novel, The Nowhere, paints the perfect picture of a young man coming to terms with his identity in outback Australia during the 1990s.

As an openly-gay man, Chris has experienced firsthand the trials and tribulations of the coming-out process. And while the British-born writer didn’t grow up in Australia, his small-country-town upbringing inspires everything he writes today. That teenage dream of escaping his hometown and longing for the fast pace of city life is something that helped form the bare bones of The Nowhere. Living in Australia the past five years and travelling through small, rural towns and the outback simply added flesh to its skeleton.
