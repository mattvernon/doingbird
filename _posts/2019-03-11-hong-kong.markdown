I see Hong Kong as a labyrinthian maze; intertwining the old with the new.

While glistening cathedrals of commerce and trade continue to align the horizon, the intricacies of the environment show increasingly contrasting character and intrigue.

The people are key within this, and having spent time shooting photo essays in a number of locations around the world, the sense of identity coming from Hong Kong’s inhabitants makes it one of my favourite environments to shoot in.

Away from the shiny yet sterile meccas of consumerism and banking that exist in Hong Kong’s shopping centres and office blocks, colour and character are never far away in the streets.  

Generationally, the location is changing. It’s a place of opportunity and excitement, yet also shrouded in deep rooted history and it seems like day by day Hong Kong is learning to adapt and evolve into being comfortable in it’s own skin. 

Author and journalist Nury Vittachi once said "You can leave Hong Kong, but it will never leave you”…and I tend to agree.
