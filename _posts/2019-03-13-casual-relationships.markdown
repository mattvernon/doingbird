I’ve always really liked the titles that you give your exhibitions and projects; Reflections (an exhibition at the CCP in 2012), Making Marks (exhibition at West Space, Melbourne 2012), and Nothing Matters, (an online photography archive/project).
Can you talk a bit about this title, Casual Relationships? To me it calls to mind modern dating practices, blurred boundaries and social rituals.

The title is a play between formal and informal and alludes to the idea of casual images and relationships. The images are casual in that they are at once vernacular, and also create non-binding relationships with other pictures from the image lexicon. But also, I do think you can draw parallels to this more contemporary idea of foregoing any of the more formal social rituals in connecting and dating. (maybe this last bit isn’t necessary? and engaging in promiscuous acts only for pleasure). The images are devoid of any context or ritual and they don’t have titles. What I’m really interested in is how they operate visually as codes.
