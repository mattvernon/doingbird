Tora is the supremely talented up-and-coming Byron-based four-piece making chill waves in Australia and abroad despite their relatively geographically isolated existence. Comprised of Jo (lead vocals, guitar, keys), Shaun (keys, bass), Thorne (drums) and Jai (vocals, guitar, keys), they make “a considered blend of pop, R&B and electronic synthesis wrapped in a warm blanket of organic instrumentation,” in the words of Thorne. Just before their European tour, we caught up with them to find out more about how their lives have changed since their first album — which gave them fans in Sir Elton John and Milla Jovovich, and led to Jai being ‘discovered’ and winding up a Saint Laurent, Prada and Lanvin runway model — and what to expect from their highly anticipated second album, Can’t Buy The Mood. 

How has your life changed since your first album Take A Rest? 
Thorne: Take A Rest created new opportunities for the band in all directions but two of the biggest changes would be time spent abroad — writing and collaborating — along with the development of our creative workflow. The later has seen wonderful improvement in how we approach decisions as a team and the input that each member has in the music creation. The same is true for the visual and design components which we still create and manage ourselves. 
Jo: To be honest life has become more relaxed... Around the time we released Take A Rest our lives were quite chaotic as we had a very intense touring schedule, but now we’re able to be a bit more selective about which opportunities we accept. It’s really a good time for us actually, we’ve found our stride creatively and we’re just enjoying the ride.

How has your approach to music changed? 
Thorne: A very strong collaborative effort has grown out of Take A Rest and some of the problems we were dealing with around that time served as great lessons in helping us develop as friends and musicians. As far as sound design goes, perhaps more dance-orientated elements are being used than before, but this has only expanded the scope of what we do; all of the original, more spacious soundscapes are still present but we’re very interested in growth and development. For our enjoyment and also that of our fans, we hope our sound will always be a pleasing evolution of what we’re enjoying in the moment.
Jo: It feels as though we are expanding in many different directions at the same time, which is why each song has its own unique feel to it. In some ways we are becoming more dance-driven in our production and grooves, but on the other hand some of our songs are actually becoming more focused on lyrics and quite stripped back. It’s quite a polarizing creative process!

What were some of your favourite places to perform during the Take A Rest tour? 
Jo: We always love playing in Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Belgium. The crowds are often very friendly and attentive, and the venues are usually well managed with nice staff who take great care of us.
