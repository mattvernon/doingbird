Benee is the 19-year-old New Zealand-born artist blowing up in her home country and abroad with an idiosyncratic mix of indie pop and R&B. Growing up in suburban Auckland, Benee surrounded herself with creatives from a young age, recording a series of covers on Garage Band that caught the attention of a producer while she was still in high school. Since then, sheâ€™s been recording and performing and gearing up for stardom. In the lead up to her debut EP FIRE ON MARZZ, and her second headline Australian tour, we met up with Benee in Sydney and quizzed the musical prodigy on yesterday, today and the future of her budding music career.
