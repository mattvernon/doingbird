Confidence Man is the Australian dance-pop band partying their way around the world with high energy, super choreographed live sets. Singer Janet Planet and her hunky musical partner Sugar Bones (their intergalactic stage names) along with band members Clarence McGuffie and Reggie Goodchild, have been shimmying from club to festival since forming in Brisbane in 2016. Their first hit single ‘Boyfriend (Repeat)’ in 2017 and their subsequent album ‘Confident Music for Confident People’ in 2018 set the stage for their impending world domination, seeing them touring pretty much constantly since then. We caught up with Janet and Sugar on a rare day off, in between their sold out UK and European tour, quizzing them on their wild moves and near-constant touring schedule.

**What is life like on tour?**

Wild, tiring and fun. 

**Who's the most annoying one on tour?**
 
Definitely me I'd say. It's not my fault Sugar is ticklish. 

**What's been the wildest show you've done?**
 
Primavera last year was a highlight. We played at 3am on a huge stage to about 20,000 people. They know how to party in Barcelona.

**Do you get time to write on tour, or do you need to take time off to create new work?**
 
It can be a bit hard writing on tour. We've slowly accepted that the best way for us to write is at home. When you're in Berlin I think you've just got to let yourself be in Berlin. I definitely want to try to experience where I am, even if it's just for a few hours.

**How do you approach creating songs?**
 
We write pretty differently to most other bands I know.  Reggie usually has the beginnings of a beat, and the 4 of us work from song names we've written down in our phones. It's pretty crazy, and honest. We're always yelling over each other and jumping up and down when a song idea finally works. I think the 4 of us are pretty comfortable to say our opinions without a filter. If there's no reaction to your idea then that's when you know it's bad.

**Who's the brains of the outfit?**
 
I actually think the project wouldn't be what it is without any of us really. Reggie is the main beatmaker, Clarence is a percussion brain, Sugar is a country-boy lyric god and I suppose I'm responsible for most of the visual elements. 

**Do you have favourite (or go-to) dance moves?**
 
Spaghetti legs is a favourite. Always makes you look like you know what you're doing. 

**Can you recommend any instructional videos for those who would like to learn to dance like you?**
 
I think the key is just committing. You can pretty much do any terrible dance moves but if you do it without embarrassment, everyone thinks you're a good dancer. It's pretty weird actually.

Sugar wears CMMN SWDN shirt from INCU, PJOHNSON Tailors pants, DR MARTENS boots, POMS ‘Oro’ sunglasses

**What are your favourite dance-filled scenes in cinema?**
 
It's gotta be the scene in pulp fiction. 

**Who are your heroes?**
 
David Byrne would be my main musical influence. I love that he doesn't look at music as just being music. It's much more than that. He partners his music with costumes and synchronised dancing and props in a really creative way.

**What are your star signs and how accurate are those star signs' traits?**
 
I'm a Leo, I feel that isn't that much of a surprise.

**Which Spice Girl do you feel represents each of you and why?**
 
I'm probably posh spice because she wears the best clothes, Sugar is sporty because he does lots of acrobatics on stage. Clarence would be baby because he's a lil happy boy and Reggie would be scary spice because you can't trust him to keep his shit together. Which is scary sometimes. I've seen him vomit on the street literally 5 minutes after we started playing because he got excited by the crowd and drank like 10 beers in an hour. Naughty.

**What is the best dance-pop album of all time?**
 
Thriller

**What's your favourite Confidence Man song ever?**
 
I think mine is Try Your Luck. I still reckon that shit is nasty. And those lyrics are just so silly, I love it

**Who/what would be your dream...**
**Performance?**
 
I think playing Glastonbury again would be a dream for us

**Dance partner?**
 
All 3 of the Bee Gees

**Collaboration?**
 
Groove Armada

**Music video?**
 
Starlight by the Supermen Lovers

**Night off?**

**What are you working on next?**

Finally home and starting to write, which is super exciting. So we'll be in the studio for the next few months, and then touring next year. In the meantime I'll need to work on creating some new costumes. I'm under pressure to create something better than the lazer boobs I made last year.
