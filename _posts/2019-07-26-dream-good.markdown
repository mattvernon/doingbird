Dreamgood is the uniquely talented and dynamic three-piece lacing three generations of individual musical journeying into a special collaboration that tells stories in sound. Birthing ‘experimental art-pop’ as a vehicle of Joshua Heath, Mitch Sloan and Glenn Heath’s interchanging familial roles to one another, the music is realised through ongoing conversations and lived experience that transcribes into effortless songs and compelling visuals. All self-produced.

Beginning with the relationship of Glenn being Josh’s father (and friend), and Josh later babysitting Mitch, the three have taken turns at being each other’s teacher, student, friend and musical mentor in life before they finally jammed together as musicians. The rest, as they say, is history. A living dream that is just so good.

With three completed videos and three albums in the works, we recently sat down and got immersed in conversation with compulsively brilliant creative, Joshuah Heath, a soccer player - turned photographer - turned animator - turned musician - and now also a painter, to discuss the inception of Dreamgood, the relationships between the members, songwriting, ‘Paris is Burning, and performing alter-egos as catharsis for stage fright.
