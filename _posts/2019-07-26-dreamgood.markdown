Dreamgood is the uniquely talented and dynamic three-piece lacing three generations of individual musical journeying into a special collaboration that tells stories in sound. Birthing ‘experimental art-pop’ as a vehicle of Joshua Heath, Mitch Sloan and Glenn Heath’s interchanging familial roles to one another, the music is realised through ongoing conversations and lived experience that transcribes into effortless songs and compelling visuals. All self-produced.

Beginning with the relationship of Glenn being Josh’s father (and friend), and Josh later babysitting Mitch, the three have taken turns at being each other’s teacher, student, friend and musical mentor in life before they finally jammed together as musicians. The rest, as they say, is history. A living dream that is just so good.

With three completed videos and three albums in the works, we recently sat down and got immersed in conversation with compulsively brilliant creative, Joshuah Heath, a soccer player - turned photographer - turned animator - turned musician - and now also a painter, to discuss the inception of Dreamgood, the relationships between the members, songwriting, ‘Paris is Burning, and performing alter-egos as catharsis for stage fright.

**How did Dreamgood come about?**
 
"I wasn’t playing music at all, but when I was 30-29 I met Mitch, and baby sat Mitch. We immediately became friends. Even when he was just a kid we got along so well. He’s got a soundproof room at his house and we just started jamming somehow and then he kind of became a teacher to me. I’ve always listened to music. Mitch hadn’t listened to a lot of alternative music at this point, so it was this dual education where he would teach me about music theory and how music works, and I would teach him about different bands. It was a weird experience because he was really young. He was 15 and I was 29. But it was a great exchange. That was nine years ago."


**And you’ve kind of been experimenting since?**

"After that education, we kind of jammed weekly for a while, and we collected these vibes, but we never finished anything. We didn’t finish any songs. We just had hundreds and hundreds of voice memos. But then I would walk away and listen back to the tracks to work out which ones I liked before writing full songs, making the main medelys for them. We completed the tracks in the end."

 
**At what point did your father join?**

"Eventually Mitch and I had collected a suite of songs, an album basically. Dad was coming down to Sydney to study Jazz at the Con (Sydney Conservatorium of music). He’d already studied earlier, but he wanted to study jazz, so he came down to do a year of that. During that year, on one weekend, I invited him to come over because Mitch and I were jamming. The three of us jammed... and it was so beautiful. It just made sense. Mitch and dad got along like crazy, they were like two little kids. It was cool. Mitch is 23, I’m 38 and dad’s 58."


**How long ago was this?**
 
"2017."


**How did your father influence you musically?**

"I guess dad’s relationship with music was more intense. He’s from a family of musicians which he came musically educated from. But it wasn’t light hearted when I was younger. Now it’s beautiful, but when he was younger he had 2 kids, was a musician, and a music teacher who didn’t quite enjoy teaching music at school. So I guess, with music, to him there was an underlying frustration there. I didn’t touch it for all the years because I watched that frustration. Now it’s special because singing harmony with my dad is amazing, our voices just blend nice - like one voice but with two timbers of it."


**What made you finally pick up music?**

"I did ‘The Artist Way’ and that opened it up for me. I did that when I was 29, which was the same time as my Saturn return, which made for an interesting time. It made me realize that I had a desire within to play music.. and then I met Mitch." 
 

**You played soccer, paint, take pictures, make videos… How does music help you express yourself differently?**

"With music... I’ve always been an emotional person. Even when I was ‘Jock Josh’ playing soccer there was this emotional world that I couldn’t really express…. Well I just did this artwork and it’s a painting where there’s this scrum of men that basically says ‘the only time it’s socially acceptable for men to hug men’. I guess that’s the world of sport. I didn’t really fit in into that situation totally, but I met some really great people in that still. Music allows me to express the underlying emotions that everyone has in a more specific way."
