Embroidered bun of parallel complexity

Two sides of magnetic thirst

to drown the game of paranoia

A side of delicious desperation seeking

against the fingering of mindful refusal

Thing thighs score goals


Deep funnelled resentment

If only the mind could be masked wide shut

Eliminate the impenetrable guilt

to succumb to the full pleasure of in

and out

Satisfied King

Valiant underneath the glory of the golden arches


A match to be played

on a bed of lonely aspiration

Wet with evoked imagination

yet lost with conflicting conviction

The Cactus carousel

Fearful ride to venture into distorted depths

Burger strive land
