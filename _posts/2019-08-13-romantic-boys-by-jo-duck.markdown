Jo Duck is a Melbourne photographer who has worked across fashion editorial and commercial photography, scoring placements in Harpers Bazaar, Monocle and i-D, among others. She’s also my sister and, truth be told, she’d be nowhere without me. It all started when she took photos of local rappers for my early-00s hip-hop magazine Out4Fame. Now she’s out there travelling the globe with a rep as a photographer with a masterful control of lighting and a strong streak of unique personality across her portfolio. But don’t let her forget it all started with documenting rap battles in a Fitzroy pub.

Jo’s new series Romantic Boys will be featured at Melbourne’s CCP from August 15. The series blends still and moving portraits to explore the contradictory nature of how we talk about masculinity. To get a little background info, Jo and I talked about silk shirts and 2Pac.

**What prompted this idea?**

Grossly, it was someone I went to highschool with. Can you bleep out the name? <NAME REDACTED>. We were in year nine, so, everyone was like 14, and he was a very developed 14 year-old; He used to wear his shirt a little bit unbuttoned so he could show everyone his hairy chest, he wore a gold chain, and he always had really wet lips. He would come up to any girl, no matter what they were doing and be like 'hey baby what's wrong?' 

And you'd be like 'nothing, I'm just buying a hot dog'. And then you'd just watch him go from girl to girl to girl and wait for that line to work. 

I started thinking about sleaziness, but then I developed it into a more positive series. But I kept elements of gold chains and wet lips and silkiness. The cliches of a sleazy romantic dude. 

**Do you think it's a weird time to–**
Yes

**Right. In the media, and in our lives in general, we're certainly more aware of not only slimy sexual predators but also the impact of toxic masculinity. It's an interesting concept that you've explored; this weird meeting place of the best and the worst of masculinity. 
Although this idea has kind of a gross beginning, I wanted to change it into a more positive thing. It’s a celebration of men who love to love. But then the more that I developed the idea, the more I was looking at how people project their masculinity.**

Obviously, I'm not a man, and so I'm looking at this completely from an outsider's perspective, but looking at the tropes of masculinity throughout 20th-century pop culture references, the references that I grew up with. 

I guess the masculine tropes can be seen in both negative and positive ways. Like the hairy chest is obviously just a physical, virile element of masculinity, but then things like fast cars, tattoos and cowboys are supposed to be really tough and hard, and then, the sleazy elements are coming from the romantic side which is combining the hardest of the hard, like a John Wayne type but then soft, champagne and roses and nobody actually wants John Wayne in a bubble bath. 

How are modern men supposed to be that height of masculinity, the 'strong silent type' but then talk about their feelings? It's just a contradiction of what we've been sold. And so I’m just exploring that visually. And because I'm combining the hardest with the softest, it's coming together quite tongue in cheek and a bit sleazy.
