In a 2018 interview with NPR, Channel Tres was asked whether he was ready to celebrate following his prolifically devoured debut single, Controller. Putting the success of his first and second tracks down to a “good rookie year,” Channel Tres admitted that all he wanted to do was “work hard.”

Since then, he’s released a critically-acclaimed debut EP, had the pleasure of Facetiming — and meeting — Sir Elton John, toured emphatically, and has taken his show from the intimacies of small clubs and theatres to arenas and festivals. And while the last twelve months have seen Channel Tres emerge as a symbol of LA’s genre-bending avant-garde, he remains as humble as ever — and now, might just have something to celebrate. 

doingbird sat down with Channel Tres while he was in Sydney to talk about his Australian shows and what we can expect next.
