In a 2018 interview with NPR, Channel Tres was asked whether he was ready to celebrate following his prolifically devoured debut single, Controller. Putting the success of his first and second tracks down to a “good rookie year,” Channel Tres admitted that all he wanted to do was “work hard.”

Since then, he’s released a critically-acclaimed debut EP, had the pleasure of Facetiming — and meeting — Sir Elton John, toured emphatically, and has taken his show from the intimacies of small clubs and theatres to arenas and festivals. And while the last twelve months have seen Channel Tres emerge as a symbol of LA’s genre-bending avant-garde, he remains as humble as ever — and now, might just have something to celebrate. 

doingbird sat down with Channel Tres while he was in Sydney to talk about his Australian shows and what we can expect next.

**You just played Splendour in the Grass. How was it?**

It was amazing. We played at like one-thirty — the way the crowd showed up, it was just crazy, man. As soon as I got on stage, the energy was just crazy. And I always love when there’s kids in the audience. And there were dudes on other dudes’ shoulders. You know, just kids just going crazy. It was just special — it was really special. It was a special moment. It gives me anxiety just thinking about it, because it was just so good. 

**Would you say that it’s one of the bigger shows you’ve played so far?**

Yeah. If not the biggest. Yeah, I think Splendour was the biggest. It may not look big when you’re doing it, but when you look back at the videos, it’s like holy shit. 

**How have you found breaking in to the industry so rapidly?**

It wasn’t rapid. It looks rapid now, because I’ve been working at this for a long time. But really, it wasn’t rapid.
