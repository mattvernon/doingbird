**Would I lie to you baby?**

A beautiful idiosyncratic allegiance to the myth of blurred perceptions

A reworked flirt of the former self

Superimposed

A holographic whisper


--


A Schiele warped around the embodiment of a biological formula

Uniformed

Uninformed

A prolonged monologic fantasy of the ideal

A shell to encase a shell


--


A Russian doll to scrutinize

A perpetual beacon of hollow disappointment

An escalation to the crippling insecure ideology

For a doll is stored to be admired


--


A cold circumference

with an interior to match

A depth that only ventures fist deep

A sponsored sponge.


--


An unattainable mystification

All packaging with no surprise 

A compromise to the age of intangible lies

Do not succumb to the broken disguise.
