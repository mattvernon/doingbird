About 4 years ago I got asked to style this young Australian rapper, Allday, real name Tomas Gaynor, for a photoshoot for UK magazine HERO. I’d never really heard of Allday before but thought there must be something pretty great about him for HERO to want to feature him. 

Obviously I went straight to instagram to check him out and was instantly struck by 2 things. 1, he was definitely pretty famous, his number of instagram followers alone told me that. Allday built his own career through social media and word of mouth, a pretty mean feat for a young guy from Adelaide. And 2, that he wasn’t your average or at least my idea of an average Australian Rapper. He looked way more like a mix between a young Hollywood actor from the 80’s or 90’s, a bit of a Smash Hits centrefold, mixed with a young Mick Jagger. I had no idea what to expect from his music. 

I listened and it all made sense, Allday’s music isn’t obvious rap music. It’s dreamy, relaxed and honest. His bio says “its landscape can sound more like the backdrop for a synth-pop band than the sparse beats of the commercial hiphop that stalks the radio” 
This also sums up the vibe Tom gives off when you meet him, its all unexpected but genuine. 

After quite a few years living in Melbourne Allday decided it was time for a change so moved to L.A 2 years ago to re-focus and make music everyday. He’s come back to  Australia for a sold out tour off the back of his newly released 3rd album “Starry night on the phone” and I caught up with him to ask him some questions I found on the internet when I searched “teen heartthrob interview questions smash hits” 


**What’s your Star sign?**
 
Pisces sun, Taurus double - rising & moon signs

**Favourite colour?**

Lavender

**Favourite Flower?**

I’ve never been able to make up my mind about that, maybe a daisy right now.

**Favourite film?**

That’s hard...hmmm...*The Castle*

**Favourite song?**

Right now? Hmm what have I been listening to...I want to try to answer this without looking at my Spotify...

**Well, maybe who’s your favourite artists/musicians right now?**

I’m loving Alex G or Big Thief, I’m just on like a folky tip at the moment, like kind of carefree folk. I think Alex G is like someone who makes his songs super quickly, or it seems like he does. Its very ‘jammy’ and he writes about weird stuff. And Big Thief just put out a really good album.



**What's your most treasured possession? Do you even care about possessions?**

That's a good question. I’m a bit of a hoarder, for certain things, but because I move around I haven’t taken so much stuff to America. I've got a bunch of stuff sitting at my mum’s house in Adelaide, boxes & boxes of stuff from my childhood, photos and photo albums. I guess it's the photos & photo albums that I treasure the most. I hope my mum doesn’t get rid of them one day when she’s fed up with it. Oh and I’ve got a little crucifix necklace from my nana. That’s probably the thing I treasure the most.


**Is there anything that you collected as a kid?**

I collected basketball cards and I’ve got all my trophies from when I played basketball as a kid. 
Who would you like to be stuck in a lift with?
The Dalai Lama, I’ve just heard that he’s a pretty nice guy. 

**What would you ask him?**

I’d probably just ask him to tell me what its like being the chosen one

**What do you think the secret of the universe is?**
 
I don’t know that theres a point to any of it but try not to do too much harm. Try to make things comfortable for those around you. Be as kind as you can possibly be. Extract as much joy as possible while enacting as little evil as possible. 

**What's your favourite sandwich?**

This will be disgusting to most people but Promite and Avocado on toast, I haven’t really eaten 

**What sort of car do you have?**

I have an old Lexus, its ugly, its silver. I just wanted to get a car that day so I bought the first one I saw.

**What is your dream car?**

I want to get a Mercedes 560SL, I like the white ones with beige interior. 
You don’t see them here in Australia very often but you see them everywhere in LA. 
Two door or four door? 
Two door so I don’t have to help anyone move house Ha ha

**Where do you live?**

Currently Los Angeles
