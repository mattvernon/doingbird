**Weekend Wife**

My forever come down

The paranoia entices

Anxiety above and beyond

all other expectations

Uncontrolling

Longing for the red button

Off

Switch me off

Nothing left to exhilarate

Until tomorrow

Where I can throw myself into your
 
enchanting arms once more

Forever entwined.
