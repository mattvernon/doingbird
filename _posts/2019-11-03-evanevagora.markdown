Evan Evagora is the young Australian model-turned-actor who co-stars in the eighth series in the Star Trek franchise, Star Trek: Picard, executive-produced by Patrick Stewart no less! Before that, he was in Fiji filming the horror-film adaptation of the popular 70’s hit TV show Fantasy Island. Evan grew up in inner city Melbourne the youngest of seven siblings and was pretty focused on sport, he played AFL and was a boxing champ until he decided to give that all up and study film. With aspirations to become a director he quickly got sidetracked into modelling, and now acting which is turning out to be a very good life decision.
