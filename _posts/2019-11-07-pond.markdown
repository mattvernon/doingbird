The brilliantly arty and always unpredictable Australian psych-rockers POND have had a busy month â€” they released the surreal and beautiful video for their single **[Hand Mouth Dancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVKcn782BtI)**, released their new live studio album Sessions (today!), and just returned home from a whirlwind European tour, which they documented in photos, especially for Doingbird.

Most of touring in a band looks like this. Note Shiny Joe's ski suit that makes him look like a villain in 'Cool Runnings'.

Our bus broke down an hour out of Glasgow and we sat by the side of the road for 7hrs. It was fun for about half an hour. We were very close to the trucks whizzing by at 100 mph.

Levitating with tedium. Exquisite composition stuck on the roadside.

Bought some fireworks in Birmingham, and it happened to be Bonfire Night leading up to Guy Fawkes Day, so we were allowed to fling them into the air willy-nilly.

Sometimes on tour you just snap and feel like smashing stuff. If you're gonna smash something smash some ice on the ground.
