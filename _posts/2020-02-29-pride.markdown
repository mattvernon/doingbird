On June 24 1978, a heroic and brave cohort of LGBTQIA+ people took to Oxford Street and
started the revolution for queer rights in Australia. The 78ers displayed the power of protest and
the importance of unifying as a community to implement social change.
For a brighter future, we must remember our past. Those who came before us fought so that we
could freely and openly be ourselves.
When we unify and demonstrate our collective voice, positive social change will follow.
It’s important to exercise our legal right to protest, not only on issues that directly effect us, but
for those who are still marginalised and those less privileged than ourselves.
We have to embody the loving and resilient spirit of The 78ers for every marginalised person.
We have to fight for those who can’t, those whose voices are still not heard, for those who have
come before us, for those who will come after us.
As we celebrate how far we have come, we must not forget how far we still have to go.
We celebrate on unceded Aboriginal land. The fight for indigenous sovereignty is the fight for
true equality.
“The future is non binary, it’s gender fluid, it’s queer and it’s trans, it’s native people rising up
against their colonisers, it’s sex workers getting coin, it’s gay, it’s bi, it’s pan, it’s ace, it’s people
of colour, it’s people with disabilities. THE FUTURE IS INTERSECTIONAL”

“Discomfort is the price of admission to a meaningful life” - don’t ever get comfortable, and settle; Let’s continue to have those confronting conversations that make people uncomfortable; because the only thing that is constant in life is change

“I think its important to make your voice heard because no movement or change in history started without resistance”  

[Joseph Althouse](https://www.instagram.com/joseph_althouse/)  
“I protest for my great-grandmother who couldn’t, and I protest for my great-granddaughter that she doesn’t have to”  

[Sam Young](https://www.instagram.com/milkmakesmeshit/)  
“My life is a constant protest, my trans identity is a constant protest. Resistance is key for survival”  

[Morgan Davies](https://www.instagram.com/morganlogoff/)
“Because giving up is unimaginably more dangerous for us (/me) than continuing to fight and resist. Because neutrality inevitably kills the victim, actively and aggressively taking a stand has proven to be the only way to truly take a side. With resistance we empower and defend ourselves, honor those that came before us and protect those that come after us”

Authentic expression drives action. Learning to accept myself and my queerness has allowed me to protest and fight for what I believe in. Which is ultimately myself"
