[HTRK](https://www.instagram.com/psychic9to5club/) “UNTITLED” – (HTRK SELF RELEASED) 2011

This was given out to friends at Sean’s funeral. I couldn’t attend as it took place in Melbourne and I was a minimum-wage employee in London at the time. I did receive a copy though but haven’t had the courage to listen to it. I think it has some demo/alternate versions of Work (Work, Work) material. One of my most-cherished possessions. It states: “Please keep this music a secret” on the rear tab.

CS “CONFUSION/CLARITY” – ZERO BALANCE, 2016

Killer mixtape by [Conrad Standish](https://www.instagram.com/cccconrad/) of CS + Kreme. Conrad’s mixes are always next level and this one in particular is one of my favourites. Spans a wide array of styles, but it’s the dreamy, ethereal dance jams on there that I got down to most in the summer of 2018, driving along the beach near Double Island Point. It will forever remind me of that moment, wind in the hair etc. Zero Balance does these awesome mixtapes, curated and released by Nathan Corbin of Excepter fame. His work is still relatively under the radar. No tracklist or digital versions of this one—I have no idea of what about 80% of the tracks actually are, as with all good mixes.

LUCY VAN & [LAILA SAKINI](https://www.instagram.com/lailasakini/) – FIGURES

When I first heard ‘Those Who See’ on one of Laila’s NTS shows I was completely struck by it. Lucy’s poetry and delivery, and how perfectly and delicately Laila’s music fit around it, adding emotion and coherence to the words. I knew straight away I wanted to release it, but of course was too shy to ask and thought it was way too good to be on a teeny tiny label. I’d put out two records on Purely Physical, and didn’t really have the funds to do vinyl again at that point. I can’t recall the details but somehow we agreed to do it as a cassette, changing the label name to Purely Physical Teeny Tapes (thanks to Laila for the name too). Lucy’s poems were printed on an A3 sheet, which didn’t fit in the regular tape jewel case, so I adapted an idea from the excellent Dutch label Wichelroede and packaged them in clear heat-sealed plastic pouches. Very proud of this one and so grateful that they let me do it. Also a shout out to Y-L Hooi for the amazing design and layout work <3.

WILTED WOMAN “DEMON WORLD VISIT” - STENZE QUO MUSIK, 2015

Killer fuzzy analogue techno from Wilted Woman. This was the first tape of hers I really got into, and I ended up booking her for her first London show mostly off the back of how much I liked this. I actually couldn’t find a copy of it anywhere for years (I just had the digital) until I walked into the fantastic Boekie Woekie bookstore in Amsterdam last year.

TOOTHY SWEDE “ROOTS EXTRACTION” – GOOD MORNING TAPES, 2018

Bo AKA Toothy Swede is actually an old friend of mine from Brisbane circa 2004–05. I remember buying weed from him at the time and he’d always give it to me in these brown sandwich bags that he’d decorated with cool child-like pictures using sharpies and highlighter pens. I still have these! Now he has one of the best collections of reggae and dub 45s in all of Australia I hear, from which he’s compiled this mixtape. On the Good Morning Tapes label that a guy known as Biscuit runs—he releases great music and silly expensive T-shirts always with cool trippy artwork.
