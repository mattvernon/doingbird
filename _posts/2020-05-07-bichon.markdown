  Inspired by Discovery Channel’s ‘nature series’, we took model Olivia into the jungle and styled her in some fierce
  looks. Prints and textures clash as key pieces from SS20 Miumiu, Moncler Genius x Richard Quinn & sustainable
  bag producers Bichon get down and dirty, taking a ride on the wild side.
