  As you can see we live is a very special part of Paris, it is a very green and  hidden area on the top of a hill in the city centre, no cars, looks like a small village with a great community, some people calls this area  the Paradise, so we are very lucky.
  I had a good time to shoot my boys and their friend and our garden and plants
