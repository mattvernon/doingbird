  "we live in a very special part of Paris, it is very green and  hidden on the top of a hill in the city centre, no cars, looks like a small village and has a great community. Some people call this area of Paris, The Paradise, so we are very lucky."
  I had a good time to shoot my boys and their friend and our garden and plants
