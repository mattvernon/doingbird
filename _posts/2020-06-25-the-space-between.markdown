Credits Text: "A collaboration between Melbourne based art director [Nat Turnbull](https://www.instagram.com/natturnbull/)
  and New York based spatial designer [Tom Hancocks](https://www.instagram.com/tom.hancocks/)\n\nHow
  did you go about creating these images together? \n\"I had the bags shot individually
  'e-commerce' style on all different angles and shapes, then I created a ’style guide’
  for the types of spaces the bags could exist in and how they might fit into those,
  then Tom worked his magic and created these incredible worlds in CGI.\" - Nat Turnbull\n\n#A
