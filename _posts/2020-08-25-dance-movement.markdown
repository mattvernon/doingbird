Credits Text: "Young Moscow based artist and choreographer Nastya Livadnova provides
  videos of her domestic based “voice stunt” work with Laila Sakini over an Instagram-internet
  exchange. \n\nThe HSC current contemporary art student’s body is the central focus
  of the self-made dance videos which feature her own recordings, audio (voice) and
  editing work. \n\nResolved, instant and intimate Livadnova’s arresting works and
  her method of exhibition (online media) render a once coveted and embodied modality
  (dance) into an accessible and viable form for the socially distanced future. \n\nVideos
  Nastya Livadnova\nEditor Laila Sakini "
