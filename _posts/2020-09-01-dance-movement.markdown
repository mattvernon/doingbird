Credits Text: "Young Moscow based artist and choreographer Nastya Livadnova shares
  videos of her domestic based “voice stunt” work with Laila Sakini over an Instagram-internet
  exchange. \n\nThe HSC contemporary art student’s own body is the central instrument
  in the “self-made” dance videos, which feature her recordings, audio (voice) and
  editing work. \n\nResolved, instant and intimate Livadnova’s arresting works and
  her method of exhibition (online media) render coveted and embodied modalities of
  dance into accessible forms for a socially distanced, digitalised viewing.\n\n\nVideos
