Credits Text: "Saturnia is an ancient village in the south of Tuscany in the area
  known as Maremma. Although not yet commercialised, it attracts tourists because
  of its Thermal Bath which have been of considerable importance since ancient ages.
  \n\n\nThe thermal baths in Saturnia have been around for centuries, as is proved
  by Etruscan remains found in the area. The baths were famous with the Romans who
  realised their health benefits. \n\n\nThe mud deposited in the basin was (and still
  is) rich in sulphur.\nToday visitors coat their bodies in the mud making designs
  over their skins as they lounge around the springs.\n\nPhotography Giovanni Di Stefano"
