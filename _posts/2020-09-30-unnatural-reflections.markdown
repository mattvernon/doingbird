Credits Text: "*Unnatural reflections is a story created with inspiration of repeating
  patterns in nature. An artistic interpretation of the recurring shapes and textures
  we often find in our natural environment. A reminder of the connection between us
  all, our surroundings, and the importance of balance in life to promote a healthy
  climate*\n\n\nArt Direction: [Linnea Grondahl](https://www.instagram.com/elinneag/?hl=en)
