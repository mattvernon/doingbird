Credits Text: "*In a Doingbird exclusive, West Australian musician bambi aka Dominic
  Simper (who you may know from his work with Tame Impala) invites two up-and-coming
  creators to visually explore 'weber fechner', a track from his debut EP unfolding.
  \n\n\"The Weber-Fechner law is a psychological / psychophysical hypothesis which
  explores the way in which we perceive change in accordance to the strength of a
  sensory stimulus,\" Simper shares. \"The idea that the less that is currently occurring,
  the more sensitive we are to change. It kind of sums up the idea that the more we
  drown ourselves in sensory input, the less effect it will have on us in the end.\"
  \n\nInterpreting the track are 20-year-old photographer-turned-director Jamie Heath,
  and 25-year-old dancer Rhys Kosakowski of the Sydney Dance Company (and formerly
  the Houston Ballet), who features in Sydney Dance Co.'s upcoming New Breed performances
  \ for 2020. \n\n\"The music made me feel like I was a cool video game character
  floating through the sky, watching everything below and just gliding,\" Kosakowski
  explains. \"I wanted to really just listen to the music and see how it made me feel,
  and how it made me move. The music is light and adventurous, and so I wanted my
  movement to be soft, flowing through the space with random turns and leaps. Dancing
  to 'weber fechner' is like dreaming of floating in a rainforest.\" \n*\nDirector
