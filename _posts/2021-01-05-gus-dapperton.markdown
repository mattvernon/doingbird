*Could you describe the creative process of writing a song? How does it start? At what point does the band come into play? How do you write your lyrics?*
It starts in many different ways. Sometimes it starts with a melody in my head, or a phrase overheard on the street, or the strum of a chord. I usually create the entire song digitally then replace the digital instrumentation with live instrumentation - that's where the band comes in. And when we play live of course. When it comes to lyrics I usually will have a general topic or idea. Then I will sing random vowels and consonants and then the words slowly come to me.

*You've traveled the world on tour - what are some of the highlights from the places you've visited? Do you have a memory of something that feels the most magical to you? How have your travels inspired your work?*
The first time we played overseas we played in dublin. That was a very magical show for me. And the last show we played on that same tour in italy where i was able to sit back and reflect on what had just occurred. It was the first time I truly saw my dreams come to life. Generally I am inspired by changes in my environment so I tend to write on the road a lot.

*When was the first time you experienced culture shock?*

Hmm to be honest i'm not sure if I have really experienced it. Obviously people, places, and things are very different over the world but I never go into new experiences with reference to my life back home. I like to just go with the flow.

*Where do you draw inspiration from when you feel like your well of creativity is running dry?*

I dont force inspiration upon myself. When creativity is running dry I don't create. I have faith in myself to act whenever i am inspired so i like to just sit back and study when i'm not.

*You obviously have a unique and developed personal style. What are some of your favorite looks from your past? Do you have any specific memories from your childhood that ignited your interest in fashion?* 

I am definitely happy with all my music video looks - some of which were from my own wardrobe that have since been sold and some that havent - As a child i used to constantly change outfits throughout the day. And the outfits would consist of halloween costumes from previous years. I liked to mix and match superhero costumes.
