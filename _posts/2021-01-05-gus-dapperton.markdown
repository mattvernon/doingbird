*Could you describe the creative process of writing a song? How does it start? At what point does the band come into play? How do you write your lyrics?*
It starts in many different ways. Sometimes it starts with a melody in my head, or a phrase overheard on the street, or the strum of a chord. I usually create the entire song digitally then replace the digital instrumentation with live instrumentation - that's where the band comes in. And when we play live of course. When it comes to lyrics I usually will have a general topic or idea. Then I will sing random vowels and consonants and then the words slowly come to me.

*You've traveled the world on tour - what are some of the highlights from the places you've visited? Do you have a memory of something that feels the most magical to you? How have your travels inspired your work?*
The first time we played overseas we played in dublin. That was a very magical show for me. And the last show we played on that same tour in italy where i was able to sit back and reflect on what had just occurred. It was the first time I truly saw my dreams come to life. Generally I am inspired by changes in my environment so I tend to write on the road a lot.

### When was the first time you experienced culture shock?

Hmm to be honest i'm not sure if I have really experienced it. Obviously people, places, and things are very different over the world but I never go into new experiences with reference to my life back home. I like to just go with the flow.
