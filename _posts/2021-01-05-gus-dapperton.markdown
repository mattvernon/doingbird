*Could you describe the creative process of writing a song? How does it start? At what point does the band come into play? How do you write your lyrics?*
It starts in many different ways. Sometimes it starts with a melody in my head, or a phrase overheard on the street, or the strum of a chord. I usually create the entire song digitally then replace the digital instrumentation with live instrumentation - that's where the band comes in. And when we play live of course. When it comes to lyrics I usually will have a general topic or idea. Then I will sing random vowels and consonants and then the words slowly come to me.
