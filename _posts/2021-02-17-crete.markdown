Credits Text: "Photography by Cathy Marshall \n\nDuring the September of 2018, photographer
  Cathy Marshall spent a week holidaying in, usually super sunny, Crete with friends
  when a medicane (tropical cyclone) hit. It wasnâ€™t the summer holiday her and her
  friends had signed up for but she still managed to capture these incredible moments.
  \ \n\nThese photos were taken on the western side of Crete at Chania, Elafonisi
  beach, Seitan Limania and in-between.\n\n\n"
