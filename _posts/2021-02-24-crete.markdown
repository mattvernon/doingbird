Credits Text: "*During the September of 2018, photographer Cathy Marshall spent a
  week holidaying in, usually super sunny Crete with friends when a medicane (tropical
  cyclone) hit. It wasnâ€™t the summer holiday they had signed up for but she still
  managed to capture these incredible moments.*  \n\n*These photos were taken on the
  western side of Crete at Chania, Elafonisi beach, Seitan Limania and in-between.*\n\nPhotography
