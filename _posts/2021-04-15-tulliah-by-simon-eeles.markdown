Tulliah is a super new Melbourne-based singer-songwriter combining stunningly sincere lyrics and moving melodies with a hint of cheeky humour and wacky imagination. (To give you a good idea of what she's like, when we went to see her debut live performance a few weeks ago, she cried on stage throughout a particularly powerful song, and then we cried with her, and then her family heckled her, and then we all laughed.) 

She's just released her debut EP Fre$h Hugs, which is already garnering rave reviews from the who's who in the music industry. One of the lead singles is 'Distant Dreams', and we invited the Australian art and fashion photographer Simon Eeles to collaborate with her on a short film to celebrate the track, exclusively for Doingbird. 

"'Distant Dreams' was inspired by a painting which sits above my piano," Tulliah shares. "My mum read out the title Distant Dreams while they were moving it, and I was sitting at the piano and the song flowed out of me pretty freely. It’s written from the perspective of being in a dream where all your dreams have been accomplished and your worries/doubts have disappeared."  

"It was great working with Simon on this film for Doingbird," she adds. "He is very down to earth and is amazing at what he does. We shot these as soon as lockdown restrictions were lifted enough to allow us to, so we didn’t have too much to work with, but Simon is very good at making the most of it, while also making it beautiful." 

On her EP, she says, "I would describe it as comforting. When people listen to it, I hope it’s one of those records that makes people want to close their eyes, put their headphones on and maybe cry a little."
