Meet Claud — the 5 foot tall, blue-haired, non-binary super talent that has been prolifically creating smart and touching indie-pop music for the past few years, as well as being the first signing to Phoebe Bridgers’ new label Saddest Factory!!! Their new album Super Monster is out now — and we had some questions!

*Your debut album Super Monster just came out — how are you feeling about it? *

I surprisingly am not sick of it yet! I’m feeling really good. 

*Were you nervous before the release? *

Oh definitely. Everything up until an album release feels 100% mine, but the moment it’s out in the world it’s being consumed by everyone else and that’s scary. 

*Do you think there are any creative opportunities that come with so much time spent at home? *

It feels wrong to say that any “opportunities” are coming out of such a horrific time, but i do think that any amount of isolation usually forces some serious reflection, which is never bad for creativity. 

*What's been helping you keep creative over the last year? Have there been any habits or rituals formed due to the shift in routine and pace?*

Keeping up with people online and being able to see art virtually has been keeping me inspired.

*What was the first visual idea you had for Super Monster and where were you when it came to you? *

My hair has been dyed some variation of blue and green for about a year now, and I had an idea for a photo shoot where i painted half of a blue jumpsuit green. I did the shoot in that outfit and one of the outtakes was me smiling really big looking up at the sky. It felt kind of cartoon-ish to me, so I decided to draw it. 

*When working on your visual projects, anything from merchandise, music videos, styling & album artwork, what are the most important aspects visually for you?*

I like when something is visually stimulating. Color patterns are really important to me as well, and showing themes through color can be really effective. 

*Being one of the first artists signed to Phoebe Bridger's record label  Saddest Factory, tell us how this relationship came about and what has surprised about it so far?*

I was reached out to by Phoebe because she had heard my music and liked it! It was a really amazing and natural connection we had.

*What is the most personally significant track you've written? *

I think “Rocks At Your Window” says the most by saying the least. It’s less than two minutes long but if you unpack it, it says a lot about the type of person I am when it comes to relationships. 

*How do you hope your music impacts the world? *

I hope my music inspires people to get loud and creative, especially people who have been told to quiet down. 

*Are you looking forward to live music coming back? Is it an important part of your life? *

Yes yes and yes!!!!!

*Who is your hero? *

My grandma.
