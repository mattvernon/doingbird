Six Fashion Photographers is a new exhibition showing July 8 - 11 at the [Centre for Contemporary Photography](https://ccp.org.au/) in Collingwood, Victoria. Curated by Jack Willet of the CCP and myself, [Jo Duck](http://www.joduck.com/).

We reached out to fashion photographers in the industry who we believe are breaking the stereotypical presentation of ‘fashion photography’ to make truly contemporary work which blurs the lines between art and fashion. 

The exhibition features [Zac Bayly](https://www.instagram.com/zacbayly/), [Daniel Goode](https://www.danielgoodephoto.com/), [Daphne Nguyen](https://www.instagram.com/daphnenguyen__/?hl=en), [Ted Min](https://www.tedmin.net/), [Jamie Heath](https://www.instagram.com/jamie_heath/?hl=en) + [Jo Duck](https://www.instagram.com/jo_duck/) (hi!!). All at different stages of their careers, it’s thrilling to see their work hang on the walls of an institution like CCP. 

When I think of fashion photography exhibitions in Australia, I feel like it’s often photography of another era shown at a state library, or an historical exhibition in regional areas. 
Fashion can often be overlooked as something frivolous, commercial or vacuous. 

However the industry right now is full of incredible photographers, young up and comers along with photographers who have been in the industry for years who are still creating fresh and inspiring work.

I hope other galleries can see what CCP are doing by showing a contemporary line up of fashion photographers and see the worth of our local talent. I would love to see more exhibitions like this in future, championing the personal work of our talented fashion photographers.

Scroll through for a sample of the work which will be shown, and also a few q+a’s with the artists.

**ZAC BAYLY **

*Can you tell me a bit about which images you’ve chosen to show for the exhibition?*

I chose a handful of my favourite photos I’ve taken over the past four years. I sort of like the idea that nothing’s new or old. It doesn’t matter if it was taken a year ago or three years ago; if it’s been seen before or if it’s the first time it’s been published/shown. I think the opportunity with showing work printed and hung up in a gallery versus in a magazine or on social media is that the images get a second life. 

*What is the thing you love most about fashion photography?*

I like that fashion photography is pretty immediate. It’s quite honest in that way. There’s not always time to overthink the photos, and the reception the photos receive isn’t overthought either. I would like more time to spend on series... but who knows if they’d be any better. 

*Did you always want to be a fashion photographer? * 

Do you know, I definitely didn’t, but I was obsessed with [the 90s sitcom] ‘Just Shoot Me’ - especially the fictional BLUSH Magazine’s Fashion Director Nina Van Horn, played by Wendy Malick. I think I’ve seen every episode ten times.

**DAPHNE NGUYEN**

*Can you tell me a bit about which images you’ve chosen to show for the exhibition?*

For me, the images are a wall of body and form (or lack of). Madame sunbathing silhouette is dear to me as I find solace in both her demeanor and existence. I'd love to print her full size and cut out a hole for me to poke my face through.  

*Is there a difference between how you approach a series for a gallery wall as opposed to the pages of a magazine?*

The show will be my first ever exhibition, so firstly I must thank Jo and Jack for being very supportive throughout the entire process. Shuffling different works around on a mockup wall seemed like an endless activity, but it was nice to be able to view them as a group and colour palette vs page-by-page within a publication.

**DANIEL GOODE**

*Can you tell me a bit about which images you’ve chosen to show for the exhibition?*
 
It was a long process kindly assisted by casting director Felicity Byrne, I printed 150+ images from the last few years and we culled down the work to about 30 images. I started to mock up layout options physically on the floor and I continued to edit down the final images based off colour, tone and feeling. It was then further refined by Jack Willet at CCP, and then I begun to play with the different sizes of the work.
 
*Internationally I feel like the lines between fashion and art are blurred, do you think that is evident in Australia?*
 
I think so, I mean there is without a doubt a number of artist here in Australia pushing their image making to levels outside of traditions, current trends and “rules”, that sit well internationally and Australia has a great sea of talent to work with.
 
*Is there a difference between how you approach a series for a gallery wall as opposed to the pages of a magazine?*

Yes absolutely, the edit for the gallery really came down to tones and feeling at a personal level of work from the last few years, where as I think for editorial both commercially and personal it lends itself to other factors such as the fashion, casting or collaboration with your team on which images to make final.

**TED MIN**

*Can you tell me a bit about which images you’ve chosen to show for the exhibition?*

I’ve made three new images to exhibit alongside my previous series of six photographs. Through carnivalesque humour and mockery, my work aims to examine the insincere facades and subjects found within religious iconography and visual art


*Did you always want to be a fashion photographer?  Have you had any other jobs before becoming a photographer?*

I studied fine arts in South Korea. The education system is very rigid and it only allows one to be creative within the box. I hated drawing then and I was addicted to video games for 6 years. I started taking photos randomly in Perth 6 years ago and only then I was able to quit video games.  

*If you could curate a whole new show of Australian fashion photographers, who would you like to see in a fashion photography exhibition? *

I’d love to see Hector Clark and Tom Cutbush’s work.

**JAMIE HEATH**

*Can you tell me a bit about which images you’ve chosen to show for the exhibition?*

I wanted my selection to be as close as possible to the images I hang on my bedroom walls. Usually just printed off of my home printer and stuck up with blu-tac. As that is really my only experience in curating and hanging art! I wanted it to feel personal, like I'm inviting you into my space. 


*Internationally I feel like the lines between fashion and art are blurred, do you think that is evident in Australia?*

Absolutely! Personally, I feel like those sorts of boundaries only exist when we pretend that they do! There is a perception that Australia is just a commercial landscape, but I think it doesn't take much of a hard look to see so many amazing people blurring those lines. Being backstage at my friend Jordan Gogos' recent show at fashion week really affirmed that the separation of the two is a total illusion!


*What is the thing you love most about fashion photography?*

For me, coming to love fashion photography has been a process of breaking down my own perception of it. It all seems quite impossible when you start. Everything seems intimidating and out of reach. Very The September Issue-core. However, slowly as I came to understand more about my own practice, I realized fashion photography is really what you make it. What I love most has been the collaboration, all the new faces that I get to meet and work with. The coolest thing is that everyone is really passionate and everyone actually cares, which is so invigorating.
