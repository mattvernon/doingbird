I can’t lie, my new single ‘Delete My History’ is super difficult to talk about. I wrote it, and some other songs I am working on, when I was going through the different stages of falling in love. I doubted myself and my worth and whether I deserved to be loved by this guy that was ready to go all in with me. When we were falling in love I didn’t value myself very highly and didn’t understand why he did. I’d had a string of bad relationships that tore down pieces of my self-esteem and I was still rebuilding myself. Looking back, I probably wasn’t ready to be in a relationship, because I still had a lot of personal growth to get back to such as liking myself, let alone loving myself.   
It's difficult as this was my first healthy, mature relationship and I still love this guy, a lot but we recently made a mutual decision to part ways so we could work on ourselves more. The time apart has let us find the better versions of ourselves and have time to focus on finding confidence in independence again. I’m still not looking for another rebound because it’s time to focus on myself. There’s an honest ramble about my scramble of a life right now.
 I’m Lola Scott and my new single ‘DELETE MY HISTORY (ctrl+alt+delete) is out now.
