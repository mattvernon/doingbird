mixtape
/ˈmɪksteɪp/
noun
noun: mix-tape

a compilation of favourite pieces of music, typically by many different artists, recorded on to tape or another medium by an individual.
‘I can't recall just how many people at school asked me to do them a mix tape.’
In early December Harvey M, one half of Client Liaison, debuted a solo project with the AA-side singles [‘You Know That I Love You’](https://open.spotify.com/track/6v5VxQOaYShyi8TyGVArrD?si=2dcc787b7bbc4107&nd=1) and [‘Love I Give’](https://open.spotify.com/track/7woUA04gnxA0PotCH9uWLR?si=a3001527a0b7479b&nd=1). They were the perfect tonic to the summer we needed to have, one full of feel-good vibes and dancefloor energy.

Harvey M’s sound can best be compared to the early 2000’s dual CD dance compilations found hiding underneath the seat of your best friend’s Mazda hatchback.  It’s a nostalgia for a simpler time, a youth spent under the sun – a time which Harvey looks back at fondly. "These elements were often expressed in summer dance music compilations that I listened to as a kid. They remain a strong reference for not only the music I make but the way I choose to live my life”


With this in mind, we asked Harvey to pen us a playlist.. a mix tape of sorts.
One that he’d make for his best friends heading out on a road trip.. the tracks that he can’t live without, that are constantly on repeat ever since that first spin, the ones that transport him to another place or time or life or love. 

The result is a little insight into the nostalgic influences of his life and music making.

And just like his latest single, “I’m Coming Home”, they are a dedication to the memories of your life.

I’m Coming Home is out now

The video clip is a collage of his home videos from the past 30 years. It’s a dedication to the memories of your life - the weirdos, the freaks and most of all your friends.

ONE/ J4 - [Try To Be Cool](https://open.spotify.com/track/1VfkybiTSGIykqzKus8mSz?si=b8afd81885214b36)
 
 My friends Louis and Bronte formed this band J4 in lockdown after watching The Mighty Boosh. It’s been on repeat ever since I heard it so I'm giving it the coveted number one spot on this playlist

TWO/ [Limp Bizkit - My Way](https://open.spotify.com/track/2gSVKxPDww9Eep5rdvtdem?si=cdf33659482c4c51)

 
Here's a challenge, put this song on and try your best to listen to it without any degree of irony. Do this and you'll see god

THREE/ [Finn, Ferreck Dawn, Robosonic - Sometimes the going gets a little tough](https://open.spotify.com/track/65g8E63towucMc1ko0Z0QJ?si=3814571aef48413a
)
 
This is the definition of feel-good house music.

FOUR/ [Cool Bananas – Tell ](https://open.spotify.com/track/7FheJOrB8J0eyK0ebcBAlI?si=4bee8be19a8f4e8a)  

What a fantastic name for a band.  This strikes me as one of those situations where you think to yourself, 'surely someone would have already thought of that'. But no! The name Cool Bananas was ripe for the taking and whoever is behind this fruity alias deserves a round of applause

FIVE/ [Ian Pooley - 900 Degrees](https://open.spotify.com/track/3nBF7oaQBAY6M2eVuUCnYn?si=5c611681c95a42ef)

 
This kinda chopped up-sampled house music remains my most favoured areas of dance music. If I think about my favourite dance records of all time almost all of them have that MPC / chopped up sonic production quality. That said, this is a total summer jam that embodies that vibe

SIX/ [Weak Become Heroes - Ashley Beedle's Love Bug Vocal](https://open.spotify.com/track/1WApNNh3hq0IVRCqkK9bG1?si=f6876ec7132a4d20)

 
You know when a cover / remix of a track is better or as good as the original? It’s always a big call but this track definitely ticks that box. I first heard it being played by my friend (DJ) Ed Fisher on Daydream Island. 
 
SEVEN/ [Young Gun Silver Fox - Midnight in Richmond
](https://open.spotify.com/track/561svtJh9LtxWtzfK7Esvl?si=e6093edae1a947b7)
 
The year is 1975 and you're driving around LA and this song comes on the radio. Weirdly this track was recorded only a few years ago. They do a fantastic job of capturing that west coast soft rock vibe.
 
EIGHT/ [ Tourist - Elixir](https://open.spotify.com/track/561svtJh9LtxWtzfK7Esvl?si=e6093edae1a947b7)

If Chillout Sessions was still a thing, I would bet this would be the opening track.
 
NINE/ [Mily - Just The Way You Are](https://open.spotify.com/track/6spqRjfBCPr0bWJTTwYmfI?si=a3fbc6ed44534c72)

Sampling Australia's much-loved band The Go-Betweens, this early 00's hit pushes all the right buttons. I always feel like I’m in Greece when I listen to this track
 
TEN/ [Sean Nicholas Savage - Let Me Out](https://open.spotify.com/track/5TpizVcAKjIvApBOqwESyW?si=a7a4416f3f3940e3)

 
I slept over at a friend's house in Paris and this came on via her playlist. It’s stuck with me ever since and now I would like to share it with you
