mixtape
/ˈmɪksteɪp/
noun
noun: mix-tape

a compilation of favourite pieces of music, typically by many different artists, recorded on to tape or another medium by an individual.
‘I can't recall just how many people at school asked me to do them a mix tape.’
In early December Harvey M, one half of Client Liaison, debuted a solo project with the AA-side singles [‘You Know That I Love You’](https://open.spotify.com/track/6v5VxQOaYShyi8TyGVArrD?si=2dcc787b7bbc4107&nd=1) and [‘Love I Give’](https://open.spotify.com/track/7woUA04gnxA0PotCH9uWLR?si=a3001527a0b7479b&nd=1). They were the perfect tonic to the summer we needed to have, one full of feel-good vibes and dancefloor energy.

Harvey M’s sound can best be compared to the early 2000’s dual CD dance compilations found hiding underneath the seat of your best friend’s Mazda hatchback.  It’s a nostalgia for a simpler time, a youth spent under the sun – a time which Harvey looks back at fondly. "These elements were often expressed in summer dance music compilations that I listened to as a kid. They remain a strong reference for not only the music I make but the way I choose to live my life”


With this in mind, we asked Harvey to pen us a playlist.. a mix tape of sorts.
One that he’d make for his best friends heading out on a road trip.. the tracks that he can’t live without, that are constantly on repeat ever since that first spin, the ones that transport him to another place or time or life or love. 

The result is a little insight into the nostalgic influences of his life and music making.

And just like his latest single, “I’m Coming Home”, they are a dedication to the memories of your life.

I’m Coming Home is out now

The video clip is a collage of his home videos from the past 30 years. It’s a dedication to the memories of your life - the weirdos, the freaks and most of all your friends.
