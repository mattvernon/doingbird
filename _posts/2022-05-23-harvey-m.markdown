1. J4 - [Try To Be Cool](https://open.spotify.com/track/1VfkybiTSGIykqzKus8mSz?si=b8afd81885214b36)
 
 
My friends Louis and Bronte formed this band J4 in lockdown after watching The Mighty Boosh. It’s been on repeat ever since I heard it so I'm giving it the coveted number one spot on this playlist
 
2. Limp Bizkit - My Way
https://open.spotify.com/track/2gSVKxPDww9Eep5rdvtdem?si=cdf33659482c4c51
 
Here's a challenge, put this song on and try your best to listen to it without any degree of irony. Do this and you'll see god
 
3.Finn, Ferreck Dawn, Robosonic - Sometimes the going gets a little tough
https://open.spotify.com/track/65g8E63towucMc1ko0Z0QJ?si=3814571aef48413a
 
This is the definition of feel-good house music.
 
4. Cool Bananas – Tell 
https://open.spotify.com/track/7FheJOrB8J0eyK0ebcBAlI?si=4bee8be19a8f4e8a
 
What a fantastic name for a band.  This strikes me as one of those situations where you think to yourself, 'surely someone would have already thought of that'. But no! The name Cool Bananas was ripe for the taking and whoever is behind this fruity alias deserves a round of applause 
 
5 Ian Pooley - 900 Degrees
https://open.spotify.com/track/3nBF7oaQBAY6M2eVuUCnYn?si=5c611681c95a42ef
 
This kinda chopped up-sampled house music remains my most favoured areas of dance music. If I think about my favourite dance records of all time almost all of them have that MPC / chopped up sonic production quality. That said, this is a total summer jam that embodies that vibe
 
6. Weak Become Heroes - Ashley Beedle's Love Bug Vocal
https://open.spotify.com/track/1WApNNh3hq0IVRCqkK9bG1?si=f6876ec7132a4d20
 
You know when a cover / remix of a track is better or as good as the original? It’s always a big call but this track definitely ticks that box. I first heard it being played by my friend (DJ) Ed Fisher on Daydream Island. 
 
7. Young Gun Silver Fox - Midnight in Richmond
https://open.spotify.com/track/561svtJh9LtxWtzfK7Esvl?si=e6093edae1a947b7
 
The year is 1975 and you're driving around LA and this song comes on the radio. Weirdly this track was recorded only a few years ago. They do a fantastic job of capturing that west coast soft rock vibe.
 
8. Tourist - Elixir
https://open.spotify.com/track/561svtJh9LtxWtzfK7Esvl?si=e6093edae1a947b7
If Chillout Sessions was still a thing, I would bet this would be the opening track.
 
9. Mily - Just The Way You Are
https://open.spotify.com/track/6spqRjfBCPr0bWJTTwYmfI?si=a3fbc6ed44534c72
Sampling Australia's much-loved band The Go-Betweens, this early 00's hit pushes all the right buttons. I always feel like I’m in Greece when I listen to this track
 
10. Sean Nicholas Savage - Let Me Out
https://open.spotify.com/track/5TpizVcAKjIvApBOqwESyW?si=a7a4416f3f3940e3
 
I slept over at a friend's house in Paris and this came on via her playlist. It’s stuck with me ever since and now I would like to share it with you
