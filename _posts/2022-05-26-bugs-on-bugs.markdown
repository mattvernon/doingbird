DOINGBIRD: Your third studio album Cooties hears Bugs heading in a slightly more polished direction. Was this something that was intentional, or did it feel like a gradual growth from your 2019 album Self Help?

CONNOR BROOKER: I think it was a natural / gradual thing at the start, as I was writing the songs for it we all agreed that the feeling they put forward would be best presented in a pretty tidy wrapping. So I guess we trusted the music first then made intentional decisions when it came to production.

D: Who were some of the key artists or bands you were listening to while creating this record? 

CB: I think some Weezer & Kisschasy bled through but I can’t remember specifically being inspired by anything while working on this. I listen to a lot of local music / Australian bands so probably a bunch of friends like TOWNS, Teenage Joans, Noah Dillon, R!Hammock.


D: You’ve described Alone Again as a cowboy/cowgirl crooner classic. When you close your eyes and listen to the song, what do you visually imagine? 

CB: A B+S ball in a barnyard littered with hay and tacky 70s / 80s trinkets like the classic disco ball. Lots of bold colours, puffy sleeves, mullets and suspenders. A few missing teeth. A sherrif rollin’ round on a big pony. Nipple tassels.

D: Mars & Venus is one of your favourite songs on this album, so can you tell us about this song and why it feels so special to you? 

CB: I think it explores a difficult to discuss subject for a lot of people who might feel repressed. It’s self reflective and about the journey of feeling comfortable with your own identity. I think music that makes you think hard about your own experiences is powerful.

D: You mention the idea of feeling alone on both ‘Alone Again’ and ‘Mars & Venus’, so has this been a feeling you’ve felt a lot especially over the past two years? 

CB: The album definitely looks into isolation in a traditional context, it was probably exaggerated as a theme by the lockdowns we were experiencing during the making of this record. Playing these songs live and seeing the huge emotional release as a result of the bottleneck that’s been the last two years is truly something else.

D: You are currently on the road on the Cooties Tour where you are playing these songs live for the first time. Is there a song that has surprised you with how it’s felt playing live, or how it’s been received by the crowd? 

CB: I think Bridge has surprised me most, it’s a kind of jump-along tempo and pretty straight forward structure so it feels predictable in a comforting way. So I think people just naturally enjoy dancing to something like that. Plus the lyrics are cheesy and cute, who doesn’t love a song about a crush (even the tough bois ™ get around it).

D: Do you remember a key time in your childhood where you thought you caught cooties? 

CB: Yeah we had a large scale outbreak in our Kindergarten as kids - hazmat suits and all hahaha. Nah, honestly it’s just a fun word that easentially means germ but when you look more into it, it’s a weird gender separation vehicle to teach to kids at such a formative age. It just weirdly covers a lot of the themes of the songs whilst encapsulating the pandemic they were made during.

D: Choosing Mallrat’s song Charlie for your triple j Like A Version seemed like a bit of a left field option to a lot of people, but has pop music always been something that has been prominent in your life?

CB: I grew up on a healthy diet of spice girls and backstreet boys, and I’ve always loved Graces’ music. She’s got this great ability to write a catchy hook but still convey emotion of substance. My favourite LAVs were always ones where bands went well out of their comfort zone / norm so we thought what better chance to flip something on its head than ‘Charlie’?

D: What is a bug you are secretly terrified of? 

CD: Silverfish, for sure. Something about them looks like they’d burrow straight into your brain to lay eggs (via the ear canal). Yikes. Plus they ruin books, crap superpower.

D: Do you have a funny/crazy/weird animal encounter story you can share with us? 

CB: I managed to herd like 8 ducks back to our accomodation in Hobart on the weekend, I felt like Eliza Thornberry but cold. Also managed to get a butterfly to land on my hand THRICE moments before answering these questions.

D: When you were doing this Bugs On Bugs shoot, was there a bug/animal that you particularly connected with, or were surprised about how the interaction was? 

CB: ALLl of them. I am a nerd. It was such a cool opportunity getting so close to so many incredible little creatures! Seeing them closer with detail gives you such a strong appreciation of their beauty and makes them way more relatable. The giant cockroaches were trying to burrow into our hands, the stick insects clawed onto our lips, the snakes hissed centimeters from our eyes - but it was the BEST TIME EVER!
