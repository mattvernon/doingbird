‘On a quiet day, I can hear her breathing’ a new exhibition of photographs reflects on nature, on Earth as a living organism.

The photographs were made with a slow intensity of exploration through the physical act of walking and site-responsive connections to remote environments.

Performative in the process of their creation, each reportage work is happened upon, captured during physically demanding expeditions.

Geological landscapes, otherworldly scenes and elements of human interference become found moments in time and space.

There’s a sense of sculpture, installation and the discovery of architecture as residue present in the work which evokes environmental and philosophical questions.

‘On a quiet day, I can hear her breathing’ is a meditation on time. As humans, we are slow to act to protect the environment from our own destruction, to halt its decline, to care for home, our golden earth.

Purity of form, colour and composition intends to record truth and authenticity; the result of a considered, long and deliberate analog process of photography that incorporates film, natural light, hand held and hand printed techniques to express a delicate balance of strength and fragility.
