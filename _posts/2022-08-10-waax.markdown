DOINGBIRD: Your new record ‘At Least I’m Free’ signals change, freedom, and growth. Looking back at the record now, have these songs become more like an honest emotional diary, or an empowering reminder of how far you’ve come?

MAZ DEVITA: I think it’s a bit of both. Generally when I am writing it is like journaling for me - but now some time has passed since we finished recording the record, I look back and think ‘holy shit, we did it’. There are some people out there that don’t want to see us succeed and every time we have a win, it’s a quiet ‘fuck you’ moment. I have been through alot over the years with this band and it blows me away everyday that it still even exists.
