INTERVIEW: WAAX
![1 WAAX 6-e3f973.jpg](/uploads/1%20WAAX%206-e3f973.jpg)
DOINGBIRD: Your new record ‘At Least I’m Free’ signals change, freedom, and growth. Looking back at the record now, have these songs become more like an honest emotional diary, or an empowering reminder of how far you’ve come?

MAZ DEVITA: I think it’s a bit of both. Generally when I am writing it is like journaling for me - but now some time has passed since we finished recording the record, I look back and think ‘holy shit, we did it’. There are some people out there that don’t want to see us succeed and every time we have a win, it’s a quiet ‘fuck you’ moment. I have been through alot over the years with this band and it blows me away everyday that it still even exists.

D: You worked with K.FLAY on the epic ‘No Doz’. What was something you particularly admired about her creative style while working with her?

MD: Well she’s a true master of songwriting and genre blending, and I really aspire to that. I don’t like the idea of being placed in a box or being typecast as a certain artist and she really knows how to stand on her own. Total queen. Total inspiration.

D: And talking about epic collaborators, you also worked with Linda Perry on ‘Dangerous’. Was there a piece of advice about songwriting you took from working with her? 

MD: She taught me to be comfortable with my vocal tone as it is. I had been using a lot of tremolo and falsetto out of habit, trying to lightly mask my voice over the years. I thought my voice wasn't exciting enough, but she said I have a real raw darkness there without the bells and whistles, so I took that and ran with it.

D: What song went through the most versions to get it to where it is now on the record?

MD: Probably Same Bitch… it just took a few tries to get it right - especially from my perspective as a lyricist. I just couldn’t settle on certain lines and I had that thing where I’d psych myself out and start thinking I’m cringe. But I knew the song was sick so I kept at it. Generally if I am off something I trash it, but I knew this one deserved the attention. Just took a while.

D: There are a lot of empowering and special lyrics on this record. But what is one that feels like it embodies where you are at personally with this record and in your life?

MD: ‘I am fucked up, at least I’m free’ from Jeff on the Streets.  I felt it when I wrote it and I feel it now. I feel free as hell for so many reasons. Not only free from toxic relationships, but also from my own internal obstacles - like my perspective on life has changed - it is all about freedom and living the way I want. I’ll own that I am fucked up, though, I am an artist, I have a flair for the erratic, dramatic and emotional, plus I don’t think I have fully escaped my fucked past experiences but I try work through them every day and am for sure making huge strides.

D: The music video for ‘Read Receipts’ is WAAX like we’ve never seen before, and sees you portraying this mafia boss styled character. What was one of your favourite memories from working on that music video?

MD: Before that shoot I had never really acted or stepped into another character other than myself and I was absolutely terrified. But once it was all done I was super proud of myself and now I don’t hesitate getting weird for the camera - it definitely opened me up to be more expressive in videos.

D: What is one of the funniest or most brutal things you’ve personally left someone on read for?

MD: I feel like I left people on read all the time in my early 20s, I was a total mess of a human, so there isn’t really a specific experience, but what I will say is that I am more thoughtful about replying or at least try to be, because being left on read is not a nice feeling. Unless they deserved it. Some people don’t have the right to take up space in your life or your inbox.

D: A lot of these songs feel like they have a distinct live identity in mind. Especially ‘Mermaid Beach,’ which opens the record, and also feels like it could epically open your future live shows. Have you thought about where these songs fit in your show ahead of your mammoth 21-date Australian tour this October - December? 

MD: Absolutely! As soon as we finished writing ‘Mermaid Beach’ we knew it would be the opener to the album… but I won’t let the cat out the bag on where it will be in the set. It’s a surprise!

D: Earlier this year you went on your sold out Dangerous tour, and then supported The Amity Affliction on their Australian tour. Your crowds are always super passionate, so what is one of the wildest or craziest things you’ve seen when you’ve looked out into the crowd? 

MD: In Adelaide a few years ago on tour, we saw a guy jump into the crowd off of a mezzanine level and no one caught him - he literally belly flopped onto the floor. We all thought he had died, it was so fucked up, it made the news. He is fine now by the way, but that was horrific.
