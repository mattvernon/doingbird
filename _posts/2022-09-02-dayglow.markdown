DOINGBIRD: Your new single Deep End is a funky and upbeat track that holds a very nostalgic feel to it. Can you explain the creative process behind it?

DAYGLOW: I made the song fairly quickly. I didn’t sit down to make a song necessarily, I was actually just messing around with a new synth I had just gotten called an “Oberheim Matrix 6”. I was just having fun messing around with the sounds it makes, and kind of accidentally made the music of Deep End. It felt so freeing and natural, so I replicated that in the lyrical narrative and wrote the song about feeling free and confident in the midst of the unknown.

DOINGBIRD: How many versions of the song did you go through to get it to where it is now?

DAYGLOW: It’s hard to say. I make my music myself and don’t really compartmentalize “versions” as well as I should haha. I never create a new logic file of the song or anything, it’s always the same file from the beginning (a lot of takes and recordings on the song are usually recorded in the first pass and just stay there with my music). But if we’re talking about how many final “mixes” I had of the song, I’d probably say 20ish?

DOINGBIRD: When you’re in a swimming pool, are you the person who swims straight out to the deep end, or do you just hang back in the shallow end?

DAYGLOW: Hahaha, I typically like to just sit in the shallow end nowadays as an elderly man would, but I’m definitely not scared of the deep end.

DOINGBIRD: Then It All Goes Away kicked off this new chapter for you, and it’s a song that has one of the most irresistible choruses in your discography yet. What is a fun fact about this track that people might not know?

DAYGLOW: That was actually the main goal for the song haha! I had just come home from a tour, and I felt like I needed to make the most pop, high-energy, catchy song I could to add to my setlist. I was just trying to make a totally new, yet totally “Dayglow” song.

DOINGBIRD: Your third studio album People In Motion is being released on October 7. What is it about the title that you think perfectly captures what this record means and feels to you? 

DAYGLOW: I just wanted to make a dance album. I thought that was the perfect title of a curious way of describing dancing, because it goes so much deeper than that. I felt like the title just worked perfectly for the sonic nature and message of the album.

DOINGBIRD: Reflecting back on 2021’s Harmony House, what is something that record taught you about where you wanted to creatively head with this next body of work? 

DAYGLOW: Harmony House is really introspective and necessary in my story and discography. I love the album so much, but I wanted my next album to just feel a little more dancey/artsy. I love experimenting with sounds and I wanted to just be free doing that on People in Motion.

DOINGBIRD: What is one of the most unexpected instruments/sounds/samples that people might hear on this new record? 

DAYGLOW: I used almost strictly analog synths on this record. I have this synth that I built essentially called a “eurorack system”. It’s hard to explain, but I use it to make lots of different rhythmic arpeggiated sounds on it. Basically every song’s “heartbeat” is something that I made on it. You can hear it if you listen closely!

DOINGBIRD: You were recently in Australia for the first time for Splendour In The Grass and three sold out headline shows. How different are Australian festivals compared to other festivals you’ve performed at and attended around the world?

DAYGLOW: Splendour was so fun and memorable. This year seemed to have been very unique with the weather and everything. We went out to watch the Strokes and spent like 2 hours cleaning our shoes after the mud haha. It would’ve definitely been canceled in the US, so I thought it was cool how resilient and committed everyone there was to having a good time. People were just in good spirits and I really appreciated it as an artist how chill everyone was. Super respectful and rowdy fans!

DOINGBIRD: What was one of the biggest misconceptions you had about Australia that you debunked while you were down under?

DAYGLOW: It’s a freaking huge place!
