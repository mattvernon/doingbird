Interview with Music Producer Taras Hrubyj-Piper. Here he is interviewed by the director of the music video Rhys Day.

Taras is an Australian producer, engineer, and mixer who has worked most recently on Sticky Fingers latest album Lekkerboy. Despite his success, Taras remains a relatively secretive figure in the music world. This is likely due to his shy and introverted personality, as well as his unwillingness to conform to social norms or stereotypes. Taras' signature style is one of comfortable ambivalence, which bravely contrasts against the dynamic pop sound he generates in his music. He has built a career on his own terms and remains one of the most intriguing and enigmatic figures in the Sydney music industry.

RHYS: How does it feel to have a track you’ve produced turned into the soundtrack for a b-grade korean spy film?

TARAS: I always wanted to make a b-grade movie as a kid, this project fulfills that dream with flying colors. Actually I have a very high quality threshold for what i expect from a film, my expectations are so high most films to me are b-grade.

RHYS: You recently produced the latest Sticky Fingers album Lekkerboy, if this experience was a movie what movie would it be?

TARAS: Fear and Loathing in Los Vegas. It was a lot of work making this album, but the more work that goes into it the greater the satisfaction. I dealt with the Fear and Loathing by remembering what Michael Bluth from the TV show Arrested Development used to say - “Now, I know we've been putting in a lot of hours, but we've got to keep our heads down and power through, you know, and sacrifice.”

RHYS: Of all the tracks you’ve produced, what songs stand out and why?

TARAS: Things Change by Lulu Raes, Multiple Facets of the Same Diamond by Sticky Fingers
 and Beat the Keeper by Taj Ralph, all pop but fresh!

RHYS: You were recently a finalist on Big Brother 2022, how does a music producer become a Big Brother contestant and go on to nearly win the show?

TARAS: I guess i was weird enough to be picked for the show, what I didnt release is that i have the willpower of a wildebeest, this was important because it was a struggle to get through to the end.

RHYS: If you weren't a music producer what field do you think you would have moved into?

TARAS: I have degree in Marine Biology 

RHYS: I was ranked first in my Marine Biology subject at high school.

TARAS: (laughs out loud) High school… (laughs again louder this time) They gave that award right after who knows the alphabet best.

RHYS: Are you still hoping to use your Marine Biology degree one day?

TARS: No, on dates I impress people with my detailed knowledge of plankton, but that's about it.

RHYS: As a producer do you listen to a lot of other music?

TARAS: Um, no.

RHYS: You seem to enjoy playing very expressive characters in your music videos, firstly in this work, but also as the world saving hero in F-POS, Classic, what inspires these roles?

TARAS: I just want to entertain, I want to be an entertaining little munch-man.
