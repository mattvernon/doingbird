Earlier this year, writer Sarinah Musukor visited Cameron Emerson-Elliott at his Inner West apartment/studio. They talked through Cameron’s practice, and the body of work he was in the process of developing for an upcoming solo show at Sheffer Gallery (You Are A Rich System - opens Tues 1 Nov, 6-8pm). Sarinah wrote the following piece in response.

We Are a Rich System

At the start of James Benning’s Landscape Suicide (1986), a man serves a tennis ball from the back line of a public tennis court. He serves once, twice, and then there’s a flash of black, and then he serves again, once, twice. Sometimes, he bounces the ball before he serves, once, twice, three times, as if to get a feel for its bounce and then with a breath, he serves again. The camera stays angled toward him for 3 and a half minutes, before cutting to the reverse angle; an almost orderly arrangement of balls across the court. Serve, serve, BLACK, serve, serve, BLACK, serve, serve, BLACK. The racquet hits the ball in hypnotic rhythm.

I start a list. Films with tennis scenes: The Squid and the Whale, Pierrot Le Fou, Blow Up, I Was At Home But… I realise there’s too many to list, some I won’t even remember. Years ago, I read an essay by the film theorist Nicole Brenez that presented Jean-Luc Godard’s tennis scenes as a metaphor for his back and forth, question and answer dialogue. At least I think that’s what it was about. Things read remain in the system as vague impressions, ungraspable. I locate the essay but it’s in a book in a library at a university where I no longer teach and so to access the book, the person on the other end of the phone says, I’ll have to fill out a form and pay the university a fee. I don’t want to pay the university a fee. Like tennis, education is part of a rich system.

We are a rich system. The actions taken by our ancestors lead to the actions we take in the present. The arm swings upward, the knee bends, the hand releases the ball and the racquet whacks it over the net. I know a woman who spent the first fifteen years of her adult life on the tennis circuit. She made a year’s salary. Then she left the court and became a screenwriter.

In a Zagreb hotel, I have breakfast with Nicole Brenez. I don’t ask her about the essay. I’m reading The Guardian via the app on my phone. The Guardian is tying me into a system to which I sometimes pretend I belong, even though I know the system doesn’t see it that way. Or, maybe that’s too simple – I both belong and do not belong in this system. Nicole tells me about one of her students, a woman who wrote a brilliant PhD thesis but afterward failed to get a job. She doesn’t mention the woman’s race and I – because I do not want to upset the system over breakfast – do not ask.

How to solve a problem. Think of a problem that haunts you, one that sits just beside the unconscious, so deep its edges are nebulous, like a shadow that moves when you turn your head. Draw a mind map. In the centre of the page write down your problem. Around it, sketch the possibilities that arise from the problem. Move quickly, without censoring yourself. Circle five of the possibilities then repeat the steps. Repeat them until you have forgotten your problem.
