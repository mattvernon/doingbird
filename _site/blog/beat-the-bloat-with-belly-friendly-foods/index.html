    <p>We’ve all been there: you’ve been eagerly anticipating your weekend plans or a trip to the beach, and then, you’re not. You’re uncomfortable, you’re frustrated: you’re bloated. Luckily, just like what you eat can cause bloating, what you eat can also fight it.</p>

<p>What exactly triggers bloating? Bloating is usually caused by a digestive system that isn’t working as well as it should — undigested food remains in your digestive tract for elongated periods, creating gas, which then swells your stomach. It can also be caused by water retained by over-consuming sodium, or sensitivities to certain foods.</p>

<p>The right foods can be powerful medicine, and these natural remedies can help reduce bloating, prevent it in the future, and pack your body with superpowered vitamins and minerals to keep your digestive system strong and healthy.</p>

<p><strong>Celery:</strong> Nut butter’s best friend, celery is primarily composed of water and boasts natural diuretic properties, helping your body flush out toxins and excess water while keeping you hydrated. Try it with some almond butter for an afternoon snack, or toss it into your morning smoothies.</p>

<p><strong>Asparagus:</strong> Personally, one of our favourite parts about spring is that asparagus is finally in season. Not only are the spears a perfect addition to salads or pasta, they’re loaded with both pre- and probiotics, ensuring your gut is populated with healthy bacteria that will keep food digesting properly, eliminate bloating, and help you maintain a healthy weight.</p>

<p><strong>Fennel:</strong> Delicious, underutilized fennel. With subtle notes of licorice, fennel has long been a staple on Indian tables. The seeds would be chewed after eating to aid digestion and freshen breath, or throughout the day to reduce bloating thanks to a compound within them that relaxes gastrointestinal spasms. It also adds a naturally sweet flavour to a variety of dishes, and can be brewed for a delicious, bloat-fighting tea — try fennel seeds with chopped ginger and turmeric.</p>

<p><strong>Papaya:</strong> We love that nature produces foods equal parts delicious and healthy. Papaya is one of our favourite examples: it contains papain, a friend to your digestive system and a bloat-free belly. Substitute your dessert for some papaya, or throw a few pieces over your yogurt or chia seed pudding in the morning.</p>

<p><strong>Apple Cider Vinegar:</strong> ACV is a nutritional superhero and there’s almost nothing it can’t do (both for your house and for your health). Though it tastes very acidic, it actually helps regulate levels of your stomach acid so your digestive system is working efficiently, and its prebiotic properties mean it’s feeding all the good bacteria in your gut. Have 1 to 2 tablespoons before each meal, and if you can’t stomach the taste, mix it in some warm water with lemon and raw, local honey.</p>

<p><strong>Carrots:</strong> One of bloating’s worst enemies is potassium, a mineral that assists your nerve and muscle function. One carrot packs a whopping 195 milligrams. Other natural sources include bananas, spinach, avocadoes, white beans, and white button mushrooms.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.soulara.com.au">Soulara</a> meals can help beat bloating the best way: by preventing it before it happens. Each plant-based dish is rich in nutrients to protect both your gut health and overall health, and keep you looking as good as you feel.</p>
