    <p>Nearly a decade ago, Heather Poire was diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease. Now, the woman behind <a href="http://sundaymorningbananapancakes.yummly.com">Sunday Morning Banana Pancakes</a> credits a plant-based diet with turning her health around. Her popular, inspirational blog has been used to document her love of food and the power of plant-based foods, along with some drool-worthy recipes. We chatted with Heather about her story, who she’d most love to cook a vegan feast for, and all the benefits of a plant-based lifestyle.</p>

<p><strong>Tell us a bit more about your health journey. You were diagnosed with Crohns.</strong></p>

<p>In 2008 I became very ill — Doctors were not 100% certain what was wrong. I was given several different medications, which I reluctantly took, but I wasn’t getting any better. After six months of “trying to figure it out,” the doctors had diagnosed me with Crohns. All of a sudden, my world came crashing down and with it came a chronic illness with no foreseeable cure and an endless list of medications. I thought to myself — this can’t be right- there has to be something more, a better way to beat this thing.</p>

<p>**What was your healing process like? **</p>

<p>I stopped my medication and began researching more holistic means of treatment - herbal supplements and probiotics. Honestly, I think I tried to convince myself I was getting better, the reality of the situation was I was a lot sicker than I wanted to believe. I headed down to Boston to meet with a new team of specialists — for the first time I really felt as if I was being heard. It was determined that I did have upper Crohns, which only 3% of people with Crohns are diagnosed with. Dr. Makrauer placed me on predinsone and 6MP which I stayed on for 1 1/2 years, finally I began to feel my true self again.</p>

<p><strong>How did adopting a plant-based diet impact your health?</strong>
My stomach was no longer angry and I felt like I had my life back. 
September of 2010 I became vegan. My health improved 10 fold, I went off of all my medications. For the most part, I have been in remission. I truly believe I have my plant-based way of life to thank.</p>

<p><strong>How has your diet impacted your mental and emotional health?</strong>
Every day I feel good about what I am putting in my body and that what I choose to eat doesn’t take a life or cause suffering.</p>

<p><strong>Any advice for someone recently diagnosed with a chronic illness?</strong> 
Never give up and there is always hope. Be an advocate for yourself –speak up or find someone different who will hear you.</p>

<p><strong>What one person would you like to cook dinner for, and what would you serve?</strong>
Woody Harrelson- a massive vegan feast!</p>

<p><strong>Secret to keeping a positive attitude?</strong>
It takes so much more effort to be angry and negative. You have the power to choose each and every day to be happy or not.</p>

<p><strong>What’s your current favourite recipe on your blog?</strong>
<a href="http://sundaymorningbananapancakes.yummly.com/2017/07/avocado-black-bean-salad-white-corn.html">Avocado Black Bean Salad!</a></p>

<p><strong>In your opinion, what are the other benefits of a plant-based diet?</strong>
You are treading more lightly on the Earth, [have] glowing skin and know that your plate is full of love at each and every meal is something pretty special.</p>
