    <p>For Phoebe Lapine, life is about finding the happy place between health and hedonism. That’s the philosophy that the triple-threat chef, culinary instructor, and author has stayed true to after being diagnosed with Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis when she was 22. We chatted with the woman behind the blog <a href="https://feedmephoebe.com/">Feed Me Phoebe</a> and the book <a href="https://feedmephoebe.com/big-book-news-wellness-project-year-balancing-health-hedonism/">‘The Wellness Project’</a> about practicing balance, whom she would most like to invite to dinner, and her secrets to holistic health.</p>

<p><strong>You were diagnosed with an autoimmune disease in your early twenties — how did this impact your life?</strong>
 The only treatment [my doctor] presented was medication. And the idea of being dependent on pills for the rest of my life was not something I wanted to sign up for, so I pretended like the conversation never happened and went on living my life!</p>

<p>In the years that followed, my thyroid slowly went completely off the rails. My instincts were right that the pills wouldn’t heal me on their own. It wasn’t until I started making changes outside the realm of food that I really got a grip on my whole health puzzle.</p>

<p><strong>Tell us more about The Wellness Project and Feed Me Phoebe.</strong>
My doctors gave me a prescription but not a road map. I kept coming back to the question: as a young twenty something, how do I do right by my body without giving up my life?</p>

<p>I suspected that the best way to find my sweet spot of “balance” was to self-experiment in a more controlled, manageable way. I [made] lifestyle changes slowly, steadily, and with the first intention being to pay attention.</p>

<p>It began as a blog series on my site, Feed Me Phoebe, then eventually morphed into a longer form narrative-driven book. The Wellness Project gives a real window into how you can be healthier without it getting in the way of living.</p>

<p><strong>What one person would you like to cook dinner for, and what would you serve?</strong>
Julia Child! I’d serve some authentic Vietnamese or Thai food – a flavor palette she doesn’t know as well.</p>

<p><strong>Best wellness tip?</strong>
Seeking perfection often causes more stress than the end result is worth. And as someone who’s autoimmune, I really believe that stress is a much more toxic ingredient than the occasional martini.</p>

<p><strong>Secret to keeping a positive attitude?</strong> 
I’m into a daily gratitude practice. I usually write down three things I’m grateful for before bed. A complaint bracelet also helps. Just wear a band on one wrist and every time you feel a negativity surge, switch it to the other wrist. A good reminder to keep things positive!</p>

<p><strong>How has your diet impacted your physical and emotional health?</strong>
Changing my diet to gluten-free anti-inflammatory foods has been huge. Food has the power to heal, and can be an incredible agent of change.</p>

<p>I will also say that I think people can fall through the trap door of focusing too intensely on diet, thereby forgetting about all the other elements that contribute to our wellness.</p>

<p>**What can you not live without? **
Time spent by the water. A good night’s sleep. Meals with friends. Fresh lemon juice. Good sea salt.</p>

<p>**Favourite recipe? **
At the moment, this <a href="http://feedmephoebe.com/saffron-risotto-recipe">saffron risotto with lemony braised vegetables</a>. It’s a vegan version of a turmeric braised chicken in my book!</p>
