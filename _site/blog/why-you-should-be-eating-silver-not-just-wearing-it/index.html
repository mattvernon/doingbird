    <p>Marilyn Monroe once infamously said that diamonds are a girl’s best friend, and while that relationship might be a little too expensive for most of us, she wasn’t that off-base. Another jewellry box staple has numerous benefits besides being the perfect accessory.</p>

<p>Silver — yes, the same silver that’s in your earrings and watches — has been providing a laundry list of health benefits since Greek and Roman times. Specifically, liquid silver, or colloidal silver, which is elemental silver suspended in distilled water and which you can take as a dietary supplement. Move over, liquid gold: colloidal silver treats a variety of medical issues that almost makes it sound too good to be true. Lucky for us, it lives up to its reputation. Here are some of our favourite benefits:</p>

<p>1) <strong>It can fight everything:.</strong> Like, literally everything: Silver’s basically Superman, killing all manners of fungal infections, viruses, and bacteria, including MRSA, Staph infections, and 650 different types of pathogens. Colour us impressed.
2) <strong>It’s a friend to your skin:</strong> It can tackle just as many external ailments as internal — psoriasis, blackheads, cysts, acne, inflamed skin, and white heads are defenseless against it. Its tissue-healing properties also help sooth burns, cuts, and scrapes while reducing inflammation. While colloidal silver can be taken internally or externally, the latter is the most effective when combating skin issues.
3) <strong>It’ll keep you healthy:</strong> We mean, we’re not surprised. Colloidal silver’s antimicrobial properties mean it’ll help ward away the flu or cold or hasten your recovery. It has also been found to be just as effective as traditional pharmaceuticals and antibiotics when treating sinus, ear, and eye infections, sore throats, and pneumonia. 
4) <strong>It doesn’t tolerate inflammation:</strong> More than a few studies have found that colloidal silver has extreme benefits for inflammation and swelling, curing most conditions in a manner of days. 
5) <strong>It does double-duty:</strong> Colloidal silver isn’t just good for your body. It can be used to treat infection in dogs, cats, and plants (yes, you read that right), and, when combined with vinegar, is a great natural veggie and fruit wash.</p>

<p>Colloidal silver can be bought in many different forms, targeted specifically towards a specific ailment or as a general liquid. It can be taken internally or externally, although shouldn’t be a consistent part of your routine. Use it when your immune system’s feeling low or your skin needs a boost, and save it otherwise.</p>

<p>Good news for those who love to accessorize: the benefits of silver can also be found while wearing it, especially in clothes partially made with it. Silver garments have the added bonus of protecting against electrical fields and radiation, but like the liquid, wear them in moderation. With silver, less is definitely more.</p>

<p>Of course, supplements are just one component of making sure your body stays healthy. Eating a plant-based diet rich in fiber, protein, and vitamins will keep your system strong, energized, and ready to tackle whatever life throws at it. Our pre-packaged, plant-based Soulara meals make it easy, striking the happy balance between delicious and nourishing.</p>
