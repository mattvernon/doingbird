    <p>As wellness becomes trendy, many people try to maximise their health by loading up on supplements and pills. However, the best place to find nutrition is from the source, and our current obsession is pumpkin seeds, the tiny but mighty seed that packs a serious punch. In just a handful, you’ll find vitamins K, E, and the B group, as well as a generous amount of protein and fiber. They can help fight tapeworms and other parasites and boost your health in a multitude of ways, both physically and mentally. It doesn’t hurt that they’re also delicious and the perfect snack to take on-the-go.</p>

<p><strong>1. Healthy Sleep</strong>
Magnesium will help with sleep, but pumpkin seeds are also a great source of tryptophan. Sound familiar? It’s the amino acids in turkeys that’s known for causing food comas after a big meal but, more importantly, is converted into serotonin and melatonin. Responsible for regulating your mood and monitoring your sleep-wake cycles respectively, these neurotransmitters can help reduce anxiety and insomnia.</p>

<p><strong>2. Beauty, Inside and Out</strong>
Zinc is another jack-of-all trades: it aids immunity, cell growth, sleep, energy, your skin, and insulin regulation, among a multitude of other functions. Without it, you run the risk of encountering illnesses like common colds, osteoporosis, chronic fatigue, depression, and acne, but luckily, pumpkin seeds have your back. With 2 mg of zinc per one ounce of pumpkin seeds, you’ll feel stronger, your skin will be clearer, and your hair will be thicker.</p>

<p><strong>3. Magic Magnesium</strong>
Magnesium is finally getting the attention it deserves — luckily, as it’s a crucial mineral that most people aren’t getting sufficient amounts of in their diet. It governs proper muscle function, metabolism, the digestive system, bone growth, energy, and even mood, meaning that eating pumpkin seeds can literally make you happier. 100 milligrams is the suggested daily amount (reach this and you’ll have better bone density, a healthier heart, and lowered anxiety), and just an ounce of pumpkin seeds packs 74 milligrams. Not too shabby.</p>

<p><strong>4. Take a Seat, Blueberries</strong>
While vibrant fruits like blueberries and acai are often known for their high levels of antioxidants, pumpkin seeds are similarly loaded with carotenoids and vitamin E. These can help reduce inflammation and protect against free radicals, in turn preventing a host of different diseases.</p>

<p><strong>5. Goodbye, High Cholesterol</strong>
The combination of all these minerals and good fatty acids act as extra protection for your heart. They’re also rich in phytosterols, which help scrub out your arteries and get rid of LDL cholesterol, or the stuff that increases your risk of heart attack and stroke and what you really don’t want hanging around.</p>

<p>Not sure where to get your fix? Try sprinkling them over a salad, adding to granola, or stirring in with Greek yogurt or chia pudding for a filling, energizing breakfast.</p>
