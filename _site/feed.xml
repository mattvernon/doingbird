        <title>So real: look inside the exhibition of lifelike sculptures from the past 700 years</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Like Life” is mostly stunning, magnetically so. How could it not be? It’s all about the human body and face — the most transparently accessible, frequently depicted subjects in the history of western art — and the human desire to wrest both into lifelike three dimensions, from the classical Greeks to Degas to Robert Gober.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show presents around 120 mostly realistic figurative sculptures, religious personages, manikins, artist’s dummies, anatomical models, dolls and automatons, including a brand-new one from the Polish-born artist Goshka Macuga that natters on about the state of the world for 38 minutes with quotations from Shakespeare and “Blade Runner.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, this time the Met’s design staff has triumphed over the Breuer’s recalcitrant galleries. Filmy white curtains often substitute for walls, filtering light and mixing the silhouettes of sculptures and viewers in fleeting tableaus. The show is spaciously arranged with thought and elegance, and full of engrossing groupings and pairings. Jeff Koons’s immense, overexposed porcelain “Michael Jackson and Bubbles” benefits from its juxtaposition with an 18th-century Meissen set-piece “The Judgement of Paris.” The most touching duo may be Augustus Saint-Gaudens’s memorial marble portrait bust of Louise Adele Gould beside the painted wax version her grieving husband also commissioned: softer material and color collude to hauntingly lifelike effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LIKE LIFE: SCULPTURE COLOR, AND THE BODY (1300-NOW) IS ON NOW UNTIL 22 JULY AT THE MET BREUER, MANHATTAN. METMUSEUM.ORG&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Beginner's Guide to Meditation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard people rave about meditating, you’ve read articles about CEOs and celebrities claiming to be meditation devotees, and you’ve made the decision to incorporate it into your daily routine. But how to begin?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first, understand what meditation is. It’s not about making your mind blank or chanting a mantra — meditation is about awareness without distraction, whether that’s focusing on your breath or concentrating on a mantra or opening yourself up different thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it. Really. It might be hard to believe that something that sounds that simple can help regulate mood, lower blood pressure, bolster your immune system, and improve your sleep, but meditation isn’t that easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of all the things on your plate — work, boyfriends and girlfriends, cleaning your house, flatmates, friends, figuring out what show to watch on Netflix next. Now imagine trying to ignore all that and turn your brain off. Tricky, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most things in life, meditation requires patience and practice, but putting in the time and effort can have a positive impact on your physical, mental, and emotional health. Here are some of our top tips for meditation newbies so you can start clearing your mind and reaping the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;set-an-intention&quot;&gt;Set an intention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting an intention before you meditate helps focus the individual practice and guide your greater relationship with meditation. Stay positive, and focus on an achievable goal — then, when you begin meditating, surrender it. While it’s important to have goals, acknowledging what you don’t have control over and the infinite ways your intention can manifest can help your attitude and outlook. It will also help remind you of what you want to accomplish. For example, if you want to start meditating, then there’s no excuse to start today.
Find somewhere comfortable: Create a quiet, distraction-free environment. Sit in a chair or on the floor in a cross-legged positions with the hands on the knees. You want to be focused on meditation, not pain in your back or extraneous sound. Just remember not to make it so comfortable you feel tempted to drift to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;remember-your-spine&quot;&gt;Remember your spine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your spine controls every nerve and aspect of your body, and Indian thought maintains that’s where the seven chakras, where energy flows in our bodies, are located. It’s only natural you want to be conscious of it. Sit up straight by rolling your shoulders up and backward. Keep your head elevated above your heart. If you feel yourself slump or hunch, adjust accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;practice-your-breath&quot;&gt;Practice your breath&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wondering how exactly to meditate? Focus on the breath moving in and out, particularly in the area between your nostrils and upper lip, and bring your thoughts back to it whenever they start to get away from you. It doesn’t hurt that mindful breathing is one of the quickest ways to reduce anxiety and helps strengthen the mind-body connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-patient&quot;&gt;Be patient&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously. Becoming “good” at meditation doesn’t happen overnight, and if you find it frustrating, you’re not alone. Start with five minute intervals, and don’t criticize yourself if your thoughts wander or if you can’t stop thinking about an assignment at work — relax and return to your breath. If you’re really not feeling it one day, listen to your body and don’t push yourself. Meditation shouldn’t feel like a chore, and after consistent practice, it will soon be something you can return to.&lt;/p&gt;
